<p>A group of Swap-bot members from Missouri and Illinois planned a crafty meetup over the weekend. Seen above are the swappers, from left to right: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Vickyen">Vickyen</a> (Vicky Englert from Waterloo, IL), <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sammie91">sammie91</a> (Linda Bishop from St. Charles, MO), <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:hiimtm">hiimtm</a> (Tonya Bentley from Fenton, MO), and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:transplanted1">transplanted1</a> (Rachel Kaye from Columbia, MO). Seated: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Elliepatterson">Elliepatterson</a> (Ellie Patterson from O’Fallon, IL), and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cwfshoppe329">cwfshoppe329</a> (Terri McHugh from Hallsville, MO).</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Vickyen">Vickyen</a> sent this report:</strong></p>

<p>_On Saturday, October 12, 2013, six Swap-Bot members got together at the Foundry Artist Centre, in St. Charles, MO. The members were from different parts of Illinois and Missouri, and had never met in person before this fun-filled event! Each member had their own type of swaps they enjoy participating in and looking at the crafting area, they brought lots of goodies to share and work on!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Terri McHugh was showing everyone how to make lovely fondant flowers. Linda Bishop brought tons of crafting supplies to share. Ellie Patterson had lovely goodie bags and techniques to share. Tonya Bentley, Rachel Kaye, and Vicky Englert also had fun sharing and learning! What a great group of gals!</p>

<p>The time at the Foundry went way too quickly and everyone agreed that we should try to do this again! Also a big Swap-Bot Thank You to Rachel Johnson for the Swap-Bot swag – everyone loved it and will think of this fun day when they use their goodies!&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/meetupflower.jpg" alt="meetupflower" width="470" height="362" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10784" /></p>

<p>It looks like a fun event… I would love to learn how to make fondant flowers someday!</p>

<p>If you meet up with other Swap-bot members, please let me know! We’d love to publish your report here on the blog. Email me photos and details at rachel -at- swap-bot.com. Thanks!</p>

		<p>Our hope is that Swap-bot can help facilitate creativity and friendships all around the world, so we LOVE hearing about real life Member meet-ups!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Gooseberry">Gooseberry</a> sent in this report of a recent meet-up in Georgia:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/meetup.jpg" alt="meetup" width="470" height="353" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9552" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/meetup-300x225.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/meetup.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>_A repeat meet-up was enjoyed by swappers <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Terryf">TerryF</a> and gooseberry. On March 1, 2013, TerryF flew into the Jacksonville, FL airport and was brought back to Georgia by gooseberry. <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2012/02/16/terryf-and-gooseberry-meet-up/">The friends met up last year in January</a> and had planned for a bit warmer weather this year. This was not to be so, as it was unseasonably cold in Coastal Georgia. TerryF, being Canadian, managed quite well. The same cannot be said for gooseberry. No matter the chill in the air, the friends’ hearts were warmed by being able to visit with each other in person once again.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The next day, on March 2nd, they departed on a 3-hour drive to Middle Georgia to meet up with <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Paige1900">Paige1900</a> and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:DiagonAlley">DiagonAlley</a> at Lane’s Packing Plant and peach orchard. Despite a bit of a “scenic tour”, TerryF and gooseberry arrived and were greeted with warm hugs on a very cold day. The friends enjoyed lunch at the orchard and Paige1900 treated TerryF and gooseberry to the best peach ice cream in the world. DiagonAlley is more of a chocolate ice cream girl. It’s never too cold to enjoy ice cream, whatever the flavor!</p>

<p>TerryF and gooseberry found Paige1900 to be beautiful and just as wonderful in person as she is on Swap-bot. Her daughter, DiagonAlley looks like a carbon copy of her lovely mother and her company was much enjoyed as well.</p>

<p>Plans are already being discussed for more meet-ups between the friends.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Over the weekend, a group of members from the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/3ac77bf8854d7129ab893f0e1776a927/about">Swappers in Florida Group</a> got together for a day of crafting. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:turtlelady45">TurtleLady45</a> sent in this fabulous and fun report:</strong></p>

<p><em>The Swappers in Florida Group held a ‘Craft Day’ October 20 at the Ridge Clubhouse, Davenport, FL. Thanks <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Silwygurl">Silwygurl</a> for getting the room for us! Ten crafty ladies</em> [seen above are Michelle — rep for Close to My Heart, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:RyeRye">RyeRye</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Stampsnob">Stampsnob</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:turtlelady45">TurtleLady45</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Geminigirl">Geminigirl</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KitchenDiva">KitchenDiva</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Craftchallenged">Craftchallenged</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Snoop">Snoop</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Bluecrayons">Bluecrayons</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Silwygurl">Silwygurl</a>] <em>from all over Florida attended. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:turtlelady45">TurtleLady45</a> organized the day. <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/turtlelady45.jpg" alt="" title="turtlelady45" width="191" height="301" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9216" />She made name tags for both our SB and our real names, but we mostly called each other by our SB names! True to her name, Turtlelady45, wore a tee-shirt with turtles on it as well as a turtle hat!</em> [Love it!]</p>

<p>_After getting acquainted for a while, we started off the day with demos by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Snoop">Snoop</a>. She showed us how to make an Ice Card and a Black Enamel Love mask card (ATC size). <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:RyeRye">RyeRye</a> continued with a demo of the round looms found in craft stores. She was making a hat.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>We broke for a potluck lunch. Oh! What yummy foods…mac &amp; tuna salad, bean salad, pear, almond &amp; blue cheese with greens, meatballs, pork sliders, zucchini bread, brownies, and snacks.</p>

<p>Then, we had a gift bag swap. Each lady brought a gift bag with goodies in it. One by one we took a bag, but the ‘catch’ was if you liked what someone else got, you took it from them…they would get to take another bag. We all received some wonderful craft supplies.</p>

<p>After lunch, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Wickedred">Wickedred</a> gave a workshop in polymer clay. Each lady brought a package of clay and we all made turtles! Such a variety of turtles in various colors. And, Michelle, a rep from Close to My Heart, taught us how to make a corner bookmark.</p>

<p>It was a fun day. We got to put faces to names! We talked, we ate, we crafted. Swappers in Florida hope to have craft days every few months.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, a group of four Swap-botters — <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:JenHuff">JenHuff</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Conniew">ConnieW</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Lilspotteddog">Lilspotteddog</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:LauraAust">LauraAust</a> — met up in Columbus, Ohio, for some scrapbooking, crafting, and fun! (ConnieW, Lilspotteddog, and LauraAust are seen above in their crafting diva crowns. Gorgeous!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenhuff1/7832667738/in/photostream/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ohioscrappin.jpg" alt="" title="ohioscrappin" width="470" height="228" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9146" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ohioscrappin-300x145.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ohioscrappin.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>

<p>JenHuff sent the following report: “I can’t get over LauraAust driving 12 hours one way to meet up! We really did have a blast and ate wayyyyy toooooo much! It was all worth it! I’m already planning for next year.” (JenHuff and Lilspotteddog are seen below looking cute in a giant rocking chair.)</p>

<p>Last month, Swap-bot users <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TerryF">TerryF</a> and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:gooseberry">Gooseberry</a> met up in Savannah, Georgia. TerryF submitted this report:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/glittersigns.png" alt="" title="glittersigns" width="200" height="278" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8814" />_A tall woman with long hair excitedly watches passengers deplaning at the airport. She is holding a brightly decorated and sparkly sign that says “Glitter”.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The last passenger to deplane is a short woman with short hair and a big smile. She too carries a “Glitter” sign as she walks up the ramp and into the public concourse area.</p>

<p>The women exchange their signs and then a big hug of welcome. Gooseberry and TerryF are finally meeting up after months of exchanging swaps, pms, emails and phone calls!</p>

<p>They spend two full days together, experiencing beautiful, historic Savannah and environs. J. (Gooseberry’s husband) is a military man and a history buff, the perfect tour guide. So even though there is an historic plaque on almost every street corner, there is no need to stop and read them. J. knows all about Savannah’s history and can answer TerryF’s many questions.</p>

<p>Apart from cementing their friendship, the highlight of their time together is climbing the 178 steps to the top of the historic Tybee Island Lighthouse on the Savannah River. Whew! lol</p>

<p>TerryF finds that Gooseberry is very much the same person she is on Swap-bot: kind, warm, glittery and full of joy! As for Gooseberry she says TerryF is absolutely lovely and fun. She is a very dear soul and a very dear friend to Gooseberry and Gooseberry’s sweet husband as well.</p>

<p>They are planning another visit next winter, when they hope to also get in some crafting time. As well, they are considering inviting some other Swap-bot members in the area to join their next meet-up.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>We love hearing about Swap-bot members getting together in real life! If you host or attend a meet up please share your photos and reports. Email me at rachel -at- swap-bot.com.</p>

<p>On October 8th 2011, four Swap-Bot members — <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:andrewlips">AndrewLips</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Kessie">Kessie</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kittenred">kittenred</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:paperbutterflywings">paperbutterflywings</a> — met up in Newcastle, England.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/UKmeetup3.jpg" alt="" title="UKmeetup3" width="200" height="269" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8548" />AndrewLips (seen to the right playing guitar) hosted the event and sent this report:</p>

<p>_“We all met at my house around midday. Everyone who came got 3 goodie bags <strong>each</strong> from each member, including Swap-Bot postcards, buttons and stickers kindly provided by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">racheljohnson</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Then we did 3 workshops:</p>

<p>I did a screen printing workshop, where we screen printed Ernie onto t-shirts and tote bags. They came out really nice. Paperbutterflywings did a workshop showing us how to make sock monsters which was incredibly cute and easy to do. After that Kessie did a workshop on bottle-cap pendants and bottle-cap magnets. Again, this was so simple, and came out looking so lovely. We all had a lot of fun doing those workshops. Then we had dinner together. Later in the evening we had a houseshow at my house, which was 5 acoustic singers playing by candle light, followed by an 80’s disco! The swap-bot members stayed at my house for the night.</p>

<p>I love the screen printed Ernie items they made!! It sounds like a fun and very creative day. Remember, I’d love to share photos and reports from any and all Swap-bot user meetups. Email me anytime at rachel -at- swap-bot.com.</p>

<p>A group of awesome Swap-botters met up on July 15th in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada to chat, craft, and have some fun.</p>

<p>(In the photo above are… Standing from left to right: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pj">PJ</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:dulcimer">Dulcimer</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CINDYAC">CindyAC</a>, friend of CindyAC, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:lepapillonvert">Lepapillonvert</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Masterbard">Masterbard</a>, friend of CindyAC, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TeePeeMaiden">TeePeemaiden</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Lostdawill">Lostdawill</a>, and kneeling from left to right: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TerryF">TerryF</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Toupti">Toupti</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:heavenscreations">Heavenscreations</a>.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heavenscreations/5944445103/in/set-72157627211398062/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ontariomeetuphosts.jpg" alt="" title="ontariomeetuphosts" width="464" height="338" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8307" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ontariomeetuphosts-300x218.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ontariomeetuphosts.jpg 464w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /></a></p>

<p>The event was organized by Lepapillonvert and TeePeemaiden. The two are seen above with the amazing cupcakes they served at the event.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toupti/5948664647/in/set-72157626984640173/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ontariomeetup2.jpg" alt="" title="ontariomeetup2" width="470" height="372" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8308" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ontariomeetup2-300x237.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ontariomeetup2.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>

<p>In addition to an in-person swap, PJ (seen to the left above crafting with heavenscreations and TeePeemaiden) wrote this recap of the event:</p>

<p><em>“We made beautiful cards designed and supplied by TeePeeMaiden. Masterbard showed us how to make awesome steampunk ATC’s and shared lots of Korean paper goodies with us. lepaillonvert showed us how to make a folder envie with an old calendar page. We had more yummy snacks than we could eat. We all brought gifty goodies for each other – some people brought a lot of goodies and really wowed us. A little bit of shopping was done.”</em></p>

<p>Last Saturday, July 16th, a group of six UK swap-botters (seen above: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:denimblu14">denimblu14</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kittenred">kittenred</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:AndrewLips">AndrewLips</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Carolinev237">Carolinev237</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:AnnMarie">AnnMarie</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:hippysherree">hippysherree</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:reauk">reauk</a>) met in Sheffield for some in-person swapping and crafting. The event was organized by AndrewLips and he sent this report:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/UKmeetup2.jpg" alt="" title="UKmeetup2" width="200" height="323" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8279" />_“We met on wet a Saturday morning in a lovely pub called The Cutler in Sheffield. A small but awesome group of members came, mostly made up of Northern based swappers. When we got there, we put together some tables and everyone put on the table the items they had brought for the goodiebags (each person who came got a goodiebag). People brought so many amazing lovely handmade crafts. The goodiebags were stuffed with treats. It felt like Christmas! Even <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mum2boys82">mum2boys82</a> who could not make the swap sent treats, which was greatly appreciated by the group. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Shortly after we had our ice breaker where people showed some of their favourite swaps they had received on Swap-bot. After this kittenred did her Woolly Dolly workshop which was lots of fun as well as very simple and easy to do.&lt;/i&gt; [Denimblu14 is seen to the left with her Woolly Dolly.]</p>

<p><em>After this a few people had to leave. The rest of us stayed and had lunch together at the pub and then walked around looking at the city of Sheffield. It was so nice to meet everyone who came. We all really enjoyed ourselves. It was clear to see how much Swap-Bot means to all of us, how big a part of our lives it is. It was really nice to see the offline community it has created and put a face to the names. When it was time to leave the sun had come out which was a shame, as we did plan a picnic… Maybe next time!”</em></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/UKmeetup3.jpg" alt="" title="UKmeetup3" width="470" height="311" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8280" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/UKmeetup3-300x198.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/UKmeetup3.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>It sounds like it was a lovely afternoon! The group says that they are already planning future events. If you are a UK swapper and interested in meeting other Swap-bot members, join the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/40829ed09bd8217dd6f1488aa7b0992c/about">UK meet up group</a>!</p>

<p>Also, if you are planning a group meet-up with other Swap-bot members, please let me know in advance! (contact rachel -at- Swap-bot.com) I will send along some Swap-bot goodies.</p>

<p>Last weekend, a group of Swap-bot friends gathered in Ohio for a fun in-person meet-up. The occasion of the gathering was a visit from <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:RyeRye">RyeRye</a>, who lives in Florida and is the founder of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/a2282f05b820a8c3db28bc9351c270b2/about">Crafting Queens group</a>.</p>

<p>Swap-botters came from far and wide, including <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:lepapillonvert">lepapillonvert</a> who came down from Canada, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:dkay">dkay</a> and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pandessa">pandessa</a> who drove ten hours from New York state to get there, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MzPatti">MzPatti</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:izohgore">izohgore</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:chavve">Chavve</a> from Ohio. The two-day event was hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:lilspotteddog">lilspotteddog</a>. (RyeRye and lilspotteddog are together in the photo above – love that hat!)</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/craftgroup.jpg" alt="" title="craftgroup" width="470" height="322" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8239" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/craftgroup-300x205.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/craftgroup.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>Here is the official fun times report from lilspotteddog:</p>

<p>_People came on Friday evening and we ate BBQ pulled pork sammies, nachos, cheesecake, artery-clogging brownies made by RyeRye and topped with everything but the kichen sink, then we trundled down to my basement craft area to share things we had made and to play a little before piling into the beds around 4:00 AM. We were back up around 9:00 AM to hit the road headed off near the Cleveland/Akron area to meet up with izohgore and Chavve. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>We had lunch at the Macaroni Grill where a most generous someone picked up the entire check (wasn’t me!) and then went on to Hollo’s to browse through that paper crafters’ dream. After asking random strangers to take our pics all day, we drove home with more shopping on the way.</p>

<p>Saturday evening we had a salad bar and more desserts and traded prezzies back and forth. Without knowing we were doing that, everyone had given each other goodies. RyeRye and I had done up a little bucket with an apron, ruler, chocolate, and some little drawstring bags she found. The New Yorkers brought gorgeous packs of nice bright cardstock for all. MzPatti spoiled us all with profile themed how to books and fabric charm packs. Cat gave everyone a piece of her gorgeous artwork, and lepapillonvert brought yummy glitter-sprinkled cupcakes topped with handmade picks commemorating RyeRye’s group, the Crafting Queens. Although we did not have time for the make and take activities we had planned, everyone managed to get a little creativity going on. Lepapillon made some ATCs, RyeRye made the items for two swaps she is in, and pandessa got the journal constructed for an altered journal swap she is in.</p>

<p>I am charged with taking the cupcake pics made by lepapillon and turning them into a commemorative medallion for the occasion and then sending them off.</p>

<p>We had a blast, but the best thing was meeting the person behind the name. It has added so much more dimension to our online interactions.</p>

<p>Thanks to SB and you Rachel, for the enrichment this site has given to my life.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>It sounds like almost too much fun was had! What a great meet-up! You can read more about the fun in <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/77195">this forum thread</a>. Also, to all the attendees: please add more details in the comments! I’d love to put usernames with faces in the group photos above.</p>
