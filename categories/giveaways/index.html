<p>Many, many years ago (<a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/02/26/member-event-in-eugene-or-this-sunday/">2009 to be exact</a>) we created some Swap-bot t-shirts to giveaway at our first ever <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/03/02/member-event/">Member Appreciation Event</a>. I have had some of these shirts hanging around ever since! Would you like one??</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/swapbotshirt_blog.jpg" alt="swapbotshirt_blog" width="600" height="525" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15525" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/swapbotshirt_blog-300x263.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/swapbotshirt_blog.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p><strong>Quick! The first four people who comment on this post will win a Swap-bot t-shirt!</strong></p>

<p>Here’s the catch: The shirts only come in size SMALL and MEDIUM. And, I was not entirely happy with the digital printing job of the shirts. (Hence, the reason why I have not sold them or given them away <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/03/24/giveaway-swap-bot-swag/">since 2009</a>.) BUT, they are high quality 100% cotton shirts. If not worn, the shirts could be used in Swap-bot-themed sewing crafts. Or, you can use them in whatever creative way you choose! Plus, I will throw in some additional Swap-bot swag (postcards, stickers, buttons, etc) and crafty goodies with each shirt package. Nice!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/swap-botshirts.jpg" alt="swap-botshirts" width="600" height="155" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15561" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/swap-botshirts-300x78.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/swap-botshirts.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong> You must be a Swap-bot member to enter the giveaway and you MUST include your username in your comment. If you do not include your username, your entry will not be valid. You can request your size preference (small or medium) but I can’t guarantee I can fulfill it. I have two of each size. I’ll mail out the prizes to the four winners this week. Good luck!!</p>

		<p>Hello, swappers! We haven’t hosted a giveaway here on the blog for quite a while… so let’s get one started!!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/giveaway600px2.png" alt="giveaway600px" width="600" height="150" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11355" /></p>

<p>Travis, Crusher, and I have been doing some major cleaning and organizing to make room for the <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/2014/08/07/we-have-some-big-news/">arrival of our new Swap-bot team member in January</a>. While cleaning I’ve come across a TON of awesome craft supplies and goodies that I have either been saving for a giveaway or for some special project that never materialized. <strong>I want to send these new &amp; unused craft items to one lucky Swap-bot participant!</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/surprisegiveaway.png" alt="surprisegiveaway" width="600" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11356" /></p>

<p>I am still rounding up items for the giveaway box, so I can’t tell you exactly what will be included in the prize. However, this is not your usual batch of craft supply de-stash items! Everything will be in new, unused condition and will be in its original packaging where applicable.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the types of items that will be included in the prize:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Two full craft kits</li>
  <li>Craft project book</li>
  <li>Scrapbooking embellishments</li>
  <li>Ribbon</li>
  <li>Deco tape</li>
  <li>Art and craft supplies</li>
  <li>Decorative paper pad</li>
  <li>Stickers</li>
  <li>Notecards and envelopes</li>
  <li>Plenty of Swap-bot postcards and swag!</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t get me wrong… it will definitely be a very RANDOM assortment of crafty items. But I know that one of our creative swappers will make much better use of these fun and funky supplies than I will. So, please enter to win them!!</p>

<p><strong>How to enter the giveaway:</strong></p>

<p>Comment on this blog post with your Swap-bot username and the answer to this question:</p>

<p><strong>What are your crafting and/or swapping plans for the remainder of 2014?</strong></p>

<p>You must be a member of Swap-bot to enter. The giveaway will be open for entry until Friday, October 31st. After that, I will randomly select and announce the winner on Monday, November 3rd. Good luck!</p>

<p><strong>Hello!</strong> Yesterday was the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/craft-party">Etsy Craft Party</a>. I went to the Brooklyn event hosted near Etsy HQ in DUMBO, Brooklyn. The party was hosted in an old warehouse under the Brooklyn Bridge — very cool! Each attendee got to stitch a cute hand puppet to keep or donate to a local children’s charity. The weather was beautiful and there were hundreds of attendees. Fun! <strong>Did you attend a Craft Party in your area?</strong></p>

<p><strong>FLIP-PAL REVIEW:</strong></p>

<p>Years ago, I worked for an art magazine, and scanning fine art images was a big part of my job. Since I had access to a professional grade scanner at work, I never got around to purchasing a scanner for home use. Since nearly all of my photography is digital, I mostly got by without one, but there were always instances when I wished I could scan an old photo or an illustration. It just never seemed worth it to go buy a huge, desktop scanner/printer combo for just a few projects or photos. It was a constant conundrum — I wanted to scan things, but I didn’t want to own a bulky scanner that would just take up room on my desk.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FliPal1.jpeg" alt="" title="FliPal1" width="400" height="321" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9222" /></p>

<p>The <a href="http://flip-pal.com/">Flip Pal Mobile Scanner</a> solved my conundrum! The Flip Pal is a mini, battery-powered scanner that you can take anywhere. It is approximately 10 inches wide, 6.5 inches tall, and about an inch thick. It weighs about 1.5 pounds. It comes pre-loaded with batteries and a 2GB SD memory card. All you have to do to start scanning is take it out of its packaging. You don’t need to hook it up to a computer or plug it in; just switch it on, and press the scanning button! Magic!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal3.jpeg" alt="" title="FlipPal3" width="400" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9229" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal3-300x240.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal3.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>

<p>The Flip Pal also comes with a simple instruction booklet and a handy thumb drive “SD to USB converter” that you can use with the SD card to load the scanned photos onto you computer. The thumb drive also contains special Flip Pal photo software that runs on Windows computers and can help you edit photos and stitch together large photos from multiple scans. However, I use Mac computers, so I was not able to access the software. Instead I used iPhoto and Photoshop to easily edit all my scans. [UPDATE: The FLlip-Pal Toolbox software is now Mac + PC compatible.]</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal2.jpeg" alt="" title="FlipPal2" width="400" height="306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9230" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal2-300x229.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal2.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>

<p>I got married long, long ago in the age of analog photography, and for years I have been meaning to scan some of my wedding photos. A perfect project to test out my new Flip Pal!</p>

<p>The scanning surface is 4 x 6 inches and can scan at a 300 dpi or 600 dpi resolution. Three hundred dpi is a standard print resolution, and scans made at that size can be printed at their original size. Scans made at 600 dpi resolution can be successfully printed up to twice their original size. Many professional scanners work at much higher scanning resolutions, but for nearly all hobby and craft purposes, 600 dpi is plenty large. Plus, each scan is very fast! I scanned over <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/sets/72157625486405726/with/5215294530/">80 wedding photos</a> and didn’t even use up half of the battery power!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal6.jpeg" alt="" title="FlipPal6" width="400" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9231" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal6-300x225.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal6.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>

<p>Each scan is displayed on the scanner’s small screen after it is completed. The digital display helps you make sure you positioned the scanned item correctly and allows you to review all of the scans you have made during a session.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal4.jpeg" alt="" title="FlipPal4" width="358" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9232" /></p>

<p>Another great feature of the Flip Pal is that you can remove the cover and “contact scan” larger pieces or things that will not fit under the cover. Once the cover has been easily pulled off, you can flip the Flip Pal over and scan… well, really anything!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal5.jpeg" alt="" title="FlipPal5" width="400" height="396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9233" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal5-300x297.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal5.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>

<p>The clear back allows you to position the scanning surface correctly. I scanned a few of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/5214681027/in/set-72157625486405726/">large wedding photos</a> and also a few <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/5221221853/in/set-1551102/">older photos</a> that are affixed to a scrapbook this way.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal7.jpeg" alt="" title="FlipPal7" width="400" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9234" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal7-300x225.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FlipPal7.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>

<p>It was incredibly easy to import the scans onto my computer. You simply put the SD card into the USB converter and plug that into your computer. Then, you can import photos just as you normally would off of a digital camera. If you have an SD slot on your computer, you can use that instead of the USB converter. I imported my scans into iPhoto and did a little bit of cropping and editing. The whole scanning process was completely user friendly and easy.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/oldphotos.jpeg" alt="" title="oldphotos" width="400" height="281" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9235" /></p>

<p>I am thrilled that I finally got some of my old photos scanned, including the two above of my grandparents. I love my new <a href="http://flip-pal.com/">Flip Pal</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Small size makes it completely portable and easy to store.</li>
  <li>User friendly and extremely easy to use.</li>
  <li>No set up – simply open it up and start scanning!</li>
  <li>Patented flip-and-scan technology – literally flip it over and scan anything!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strike>The included Flip Pal software only works on Windows computers.</strike>
    <p>The software now works on both Mac and PC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The scanning surface is small – 4 x 6 inches.</li>
  <li>Maximum scanning resolution is 600 dpi – some projects may call for a higher res.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Required Disclosure: I was given this product at no-cost for review purposes.</em></p>

<p>In an attempt to spread the good word about Swap-bot and to learn more about running an online business, I sometimes attend conferences. You may remember my posts about <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/08/13/friday-link-love-blogher-edition/">Blogher in 2010</a> and <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/09/16/friday-link-love-blogher-handmade/">BlogHer Handmade</a> last year. Last week, I was at <a href="http://www.blogher.com/blogher-12">BlogHer 2012</a> right here in New York City, and I picked up a few <strong>links</strong> for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Martha Stewart was one of the keynote speakers. She was as <del datetime="2012-08-07T16:04:18+00:00">arrogant</del> confident as ever, but she was also really funny. She is definitely a hard worker and I think she might be a genius. Anyhoo, she has a new show, <a href="http://www.themarthablog.com/2012/07/introducing-my-new-show-martha-stewarts-cooking-school-at-the-tca-press-tour.html">Martha Stewart’s Cooking School</a>, starting in October on PBS. It looks very lovely.</li>
  <li>Not a blog, but maybe a helpful tool: <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a>. Track how you spend your time online and be more productive.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.girlaroundtown.net/">Girl Around Town</a> – A women’s lifestyle site (similar to <a href="http://www.dailycandy.com/everywhere/">Daily Candy</a>) covering NYC, Houston, and LA.</li>

<p><strong>Now for the GIVEAWAY!</strong></p>

<p>Like usual, attendees received quite a bit of swag at BlogHer 2012. I didn’t want to be greedy this year, but I did get some fun stuff, as seen below. And, I have a SURPRISE group of goodies to send to one lucky Swap-botter! The surprise swag grab bag will NOT include everything you see below, but it does include some great stuff, plus a healthy dose of Swap-bot postcards, pins, and stickers. Fun!</p>

<p>Last week I had</p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://buycialisonline1.com/" title="buy cialis online">buy cialis online</a>
</div>

<p>the opportunity to visit <a href="http://www.pinsandneedlesnyc.com/">Pins &amp; Needles</a>, an adorable sewing and craft boutique in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. I was there for a <a href="http://www.acedepartment.com/blog/2012/02/14/bank-on-your-bliss/">seminar on creative entrepreneurship</a> with <a href="http://nancysoriano.com/">Nancy Soriano</a>, but I was also excited to check out the crafty shop for the first time.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pinsandneedlesstore.png" alt="" title="pinsandneedlesstore" width="470" height="319" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8797" /></p>

<p>Pins &amp; Needles is owned by Rachel Low (whom I met at the <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=4415">Creative Connection conference</a> last year) and it caters to crafters who enjoy sewing, fabric crafts, and needlework. The shop stocks fabric and notions from around the world, plus patterns, needlepoint and embroidery supplies, stitching kits, ribbon and trim. Pins &amp; Needles also offers <a href="http://www.pinsandneedlesnyc.com/classes/">classes</a> for all ages and skill levels.</p>

<p>I absolutely recommend visiting the charming store in-person, but if you are outside NYC, you can <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/startstitching1045">shop online</a> or follow along with the <a href="http://www.pinsandneedlesnyc.com/blog/">Pins &amp; Needles blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/StartStitching">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pinsandneedlesgiveaway.png" alt="" title="pinsandneedlesgiveaway" width="470" height="303" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8798" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pinsandneedlesgiveaway-300x193.png 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pinsandneedlesgiveaway.png 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p><em>And now a special Valentine’s Day treat just for you:</em> Rachel from Pins &amp; Needles was extremely generous and donated this beautiful stack of <a href="http://www.jansdotter.com/">Lotta Jansdotter</a> fabric to <strong>giveaway</strong> right here on the blog! One lucky reader will win this stack of six fat quarters of fabric, plus a cute canvas carrying bag. (There will probably be a few Swap-bot goodies thrown in there as well.)</p>

<p>To enter the giveaway, <strong>comment</strong> on this blog post and answer the following question: <strong>What fabric craft would you most like to complete?</strong> (For me, the answer is definitely a quilt!) <strong>Please include your name, email address, and Swap-bot username when you comment.</strong> The giveaway will be open for entry until Friday, February 24th. The winner will be announced on Sunday, February 26th. Good luck!</p>

		<p>You already know that I was at the <a href="http://www.blogher.com/blogher-handmade">BlogHer Handmade</a> and <a href="http://www.thecreativeconnectionevent.com/">Creative Connection</a> conference last week. The three-day event was packed with classes, keynotes, tutorials, and a handmade marketplace. We heard from Holly Becker of <a href="http://decor8blog.com/">decor8</a>, <a href="http://www.oprah.com/packages/cooking-with-cristina-ferrare.html">Christina Ferrare</a>, <a href="http://www.jopackham.com/">Jo Packham</a>, publisher of <a href="http://www.wherewomencreate.com/">Where Women Create</a>, <a href="http://stacyjulian.com/">Stacy Julian</a> of <a href="http://www.bigpictureclasses.com/">Big Picture Classes</a>, and many more accomplished, smart women. My favorite class was Inspiration Boards taught by Leslie Shewring of <a href="http://acreativemint.typepad.com/">A Creative Mint</a>.</p>

<p>It was an inspiring and informative event, and it was great to meet in person some of the women I have been following online. It is motivating to see so many creative women starting their own businesses. (If you’d like to read more about the conference, I am in the process of putting together a full recap on my <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/">personal blog</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Now, on to the GIVEAWAY!!</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/BlogHergiveaway.jpg" alt="" title="BlogHergiveaway" width="470" height="570" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8453" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/BlogHergiveaway-247x300.jpg 247w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/BlogHergiveaway.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>One of the reasons that many people love these creative conferences is because you come home with lots and lots of swag. The Creative Connection was no different. At nearly every meal we were given a little gift from one of the sponsors and publishers were there giving away free copies of their magazines and books.</p>

<p>You, my lovely Swap-bot users, are always in the forefront of my mind, so I made sure to grab a few extra items when I could. I was planning this giveaway from the beginning and I think I collected a great prize pack… one lucky winner will receive the following bundle of goodies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Home Made Simple</em> – a hardcover book full of recipes and home tips gathered from the <a href="http://www.homemadesimple.com/">Home Made Simple</a> website.</li>
  <li>Two Minneapolis postcards – which I purchased before realizing that the conference was actually in Saint Paul. Whoops.</li>
  <li>A large tote bag from <a href="http://www.archiversonline.com/">Archiver’s</a>.</li>
  <li>The Oct/Nov issue of <a href="http://www.americancraftmag.org/">American Craft magazine</a>.</li>

<p>You may have noticed that once again the Swap-bot blog has been a bit quiet… well, this time I have a very good reason!! Last week I took a trip to Kentucky (to visit my sweet grandma) and I got to check out <a href="http://quiltmuseum.org/">The National Quilt Museum</a> in <a href="http://www.paducah.travel/">Paducah</a>. Paducah is a city of about 30,000 in western Kentucky with a thriving arts community.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltmuseum2.jpg" alt="" title="quiltmuseum2" width="470" height="345" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7962" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltmuseum2-300x220.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltmuseum2.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>I love museums and will visit one anywhere I can, but <a href="http://quiltmuseum.org/">The National Quilt Museum</a> was a real treat because it combines my love of museums with my love of craft. I did not know what to expect from the The National Quilt Museum, but I was blown away by the gorgeous building, the amazing quilts, and the professionalism of the exhibits.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltmuseum3.jpg" alt="" title="quiltmuseum3" width="470" height="318" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7963" /></p>

<p><a href="http://quiltmuseum.org/">The National Quilt Museum</a> was opened in 1991 and honors today’s quilter, meaning that it mostly displays contemporary quilts from around the country. The Museum “is the portal to the contemporary quilt experience through traditional and non-traditional quiltmaking. It is the gateway to the discovery of quilts, quiltmaking, and the quilt artist. The Museum is committed to be the best in quilt exhibitions, quilt education, and quilt experience.” The quilts on display were truly stunning and many of them are winners of the American Quilters Society annual contest. Most were machine pieced, but hand quilted, and the detail was mind boggling!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltmusem4.jpg" alt="" title="quiltmusem4" width="470" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7964" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltmusem4-300x216.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltmusem4.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>Above is a photo of the stained glass quilts in the Museum lobby. Sadly, photography was not allowed within the exhibit halls, but you can check out the Museum’s entire collection online via <a href="http://www.quiltindex.org/search_results.php?collection=Museum%20of%20the%20American%20Quilter's%20Society">The Quilt Index</a>. The online photo does not do it justice (nor does it show the jewel-encrusted pattern on the back), but <em>Sedona Rose&lt;/a&gt;</em> by Sharon Schamber was my favorite of the quilts on view. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltmuseum5.jpg" alt="" title="quiltmuseum5" width="470" height="353" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7965" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltmuseum5-300x225.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltmuseum5.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>The National Quilt Museum also focuses on education and community involvement. Above are some of the yo-yos made by the Yo Yo Club of Paducah which meets at the Museum. The Museum also hosts an annual <a href="http://www.nationalquiltmuseum.org/contests_school.htm">School Block Challenge</a>, a quilting contest for children. The 2011 School Block Challenge winners are currently on view at the museum and it was fun to see all of the creative things submitted by students from all over the country. The best part: while I was at the museum, two teenage boys came through to check out their quilt block which had won a third place prize! Not only is The National Quilt Museum getting teens interested in art and craft, but they are breaking down gender stereotypes, too! I love it!</p>

<p>If you are ever in Kentucky, I strongly encourage a trip to The National Quilt Museum, especially if you want to be inspired to take your own crafting to the next level.</p>

<p>—-</p>

<p>Now the fun part – a <strong>Giveaway!</strong> I have a few items from the Museum gift shop to give away to one lucky winner!!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltgiveaway.jpg" alt="" title="quiltgiveaway" width="470" height="387" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7966" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltgiveaway-300x247.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/quiltgiveaway.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>Etsy.com is hosting a <a href="http://www.etsy.com/storque/seller-handbook/etsy-success-symposium-11615/">Success Symposium</a> here in Brooklyn on Tuesday, February 8th. The event is a day-long conference at the Etsy headquarters for Etsy sellers that will help them take their small businesses to the next level. There will be workshops and talks led by industry experts, plus food, and a fun, in-person swap hosted by us, Swap-bot, at the end of the day! <a href="http://www.etsy.com/storque/seller-handbook/etsy-success-symposium-11615/">Learn more about the speakers and details here.</a></p>

<p>The sad news is that all of the tickets for the event are <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/66145019/etsy-success-symposium-event">sold out</a>. BUT WAIT! As one of the sponsors of the event, I have <strong>three scholarships</strong> available to give to three Swap-bot members who would like to attend the event. If you are in the New York CIty area (or will be on February 8th) and have an active Etsy store and Swap-bot account, you can apply to win one of the scholarships!</p>

<p>If you read my <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/">personal blog</a> or follow my personal <a href="http://twitter.com/rljart">Twitter account</a>, you know that I attended the <a href="http://www.blogher.com/conferences">BlogHer</a> conference last weekend in New York. I was not sure what to expect, but since it was hosted near me this year I decided to give it a try. I was hoping to network and spread the good word about Swap-bot. It turns out that there weren’t a ton of art and craft bloggers there, but I did get to do plenty of networking with cool women and I attended some informative classes. Below are some of the links I collected along the way…</p>

<p><strong>GIVEAWAY</strong></p>

<p>I also picked up a bunch of free swag at the conference. In the expo area companies were handing out free product like it was candy! (And, some of it was candy.) I have a very random group of swag to GIVE AWAY to one person… The package will include a Microsoft tote bag, a Cherrios T-shirt (adult size medium), an Arm &amp; Hammer mouse pad, a new Febreze “Set and Refresh,” a Firefox keychain, a unicorn lollipop, some Downey fabric softener, a General Mills pocket mirror, an AOL pocket notepad and pen, hand sanitizer from Yahoo!, an Etsy party favor pack with lip gloss and pins, and the BIG PRIZE: a $10 gift card to Toys R Us! To enter to win this really bizarre – but great, right? – collection of goodies, comment on this post with a link to one of your favorite craft blogs or female bloggers.</p>

<p>You must include your Swap-bot username in your comment. The drawing will be open for entry until Wednesday, August 18th. I will randomly select and announce the winner next Thursday.</p>

<p>_Dannielle Molesworth aka on Mar 17th, 2010:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>For my Craft Month Celebration I am volunteering at a local nursing home for arts &amp; crafts. Teaching and assiting the elderly with a craft I donated. So many do not have any visitors and they love to recieve things or make things they can keep. I felt that was a great way to celebrate craft month. &lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Congrats to Dannielle! She will receive a wonderful selection of items handmade by Biasbabe.</p>

<p>I love buttons! Specifically one-inch, pin-back buttons that many companies and artists use to promote their work, like the Swap-bot buttons seen above. I have a huge collection!</p>

<p>My favorite place to order the pin-back buttons I design is I have been ordering from Busy Beaver for years for both personal designs and Swap-bot buttons. I love their quality and their awesome customer service, so I was excited when they offered to sponsor a button swap and a giveaway on the ‘bot!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/58430">  <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ButtonSwap2010wide.gif" alt="ButtonSwap2010wide" title="ButtonSwap2010wide" width="470" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5091" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ButtonSwap2010wide-300x268.gif 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ButtonSwap2010wide.gif 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>

<p>If you love buttons, too, join the ! It is a really fun and easy swap – simply send three cool, pin-back buttons to your swap partner and receive three buttons in return. It is a great way to share and diversify your button collection! The swap is international and open to new users.</p>

<p>March is National Craft Month! What a terrific reason to celebrate! For those of us who love to craft, vow to try a new crafting technique during National Craft Month; or perhaps you can teach someone how to do your favorite craft. National Craft Month can also be the perfect excuse to pull all those half-finished projects out of their hiding places and get them done. For those who don’t make crafts, what better reason to start crafting? Crafting has many benefits; it can help reduce stress, bring families closer together, and you can learn new skills also!</p>

She is the person that told me about Swap-bot and she knew it would be good for me. She was so right. Here is a to her ATC. ATC’s are so much fun to do and to receive. I am glad that ATC’s are something that everyone that wants to can do. You do not have to have a ton of supplies and they are not expensive to mail. Just about the perfect little mail art project. Looking thru my ATC album is almost like looking thru a family album. As I look at them I remember who made them and a little about the person as well.”</em></p>

<p><strong>AndreaSmondria</strong><em>&lt;/a&gt;: “my favorite atc that i made was for the i love the 80’s swap, it was of the flock of seagull hair style. it turned out great and i really didn’t want to part with it. But i did and my partner loved it also.”</em> &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Congratulations to the winners! Thank you to everyone for entering. Stay tuned because there will be more giveaways happening in the near future… (hint: have you seen the ? very cool.)</p>

<p>We have been going through a dry spell in regard to giveaways here on the Swap-bot blog, but we are back with a bang! I have an amazing set of ATC-related goodies to send to one lucky winner. The set includes the , which comes with 20 blank ATC cards that are pre-punched to hang on the carousel, plus (to use with your existing ATCs to hang them on the carousel), (for organizing your ATCs on the carousel), and the special (which creates the perfect little notches used to hang cards on the carousel).</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/atcgiveaway.jpg" alt="atcgiveaway" title="atcgiveaway" width="470" height="540" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2590" /></p>

<p>It is a really nice set of ATC tools – over $50 in value! I have been intrigued by the 7 gypsies carousel ever since I saw it online, but I recently saw one in action at a craft store and I was impressed. It is made of heavy metal and the cards actually attach to it pretty securely, but they are also easily removed and switched around. If you are not into ATCs, the carousel can be used as a mini, vertical scrapbook of sorts. You can put photos in the sleeves and decorate the cards with journaling or more photos.</p>

<p>Because this giveaway is slightly larger than usual, there are two ways to enter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Post a comment here on the blog telling us about your favorite ATC you have made or received, and/or…
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Post about Swap-bot (it can be about this giveaway, or about Swap-bot in general) somewhere on the web (your blog, twitter, a public forum) and link to your post in your comment. &lt;/ol&gt; 
Make sure to include your Swap-bot username and email address in your comment or your entry will not be counted. Each person can enter this giveaway drawing up to two times by making both types of comments. Please make a separate comment for each entry. The deadline for entering this giveaway is Friday, September 18th. The winner will be randomly drawn and announced on Sunday, September 20th. If you have trouble commenting on the blog, you can send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. Good luck!</p>

        <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A few of your comments got caught in our spam filter, but I think I have approved them all as of today (9/10/09) and they should be showing up below. I will continue to check through the spam comments to see if it mislabeled any legitimate comments. I don’t want anyone to miss out on this giveaway!</p>

<p>Swap-bot is a fan of Twitter! You can follow Swap-bot on Twitter two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Swapbot">Swapbot</a></strong> – The original Swap-bot Twitter account publishes every new, public swap as it is created.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/SwapbotNews">SwapbotNews</a></strong> – The new Twitter account which only publishes news and announcements about Swap-bot.</li>
</ul>

<p>To help spread the word about Swap-bot on Twitter we are giving away a <a href="http://www.brother-usa.com/ptouch/modeldetail.aspx?PRODUCTID=PT70">Brother P-Touch handheld labeling system</a> to one lucky winner. The P-Touch makes instant labels and is great for organizing or crafts, but I like to think of it as a manual Twitter device!</p>

<p>To enter this giveaway you must have a <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> account (they are free and easy to set up) and a Swap-bot account in good standing with a valid mailing address. Next, make a Tweet about Swap-bot – you can promote a swap you are hosting, show off your profile page, or simply ReTweet the <a href="http://twitter.com/SwapbotNews/status/2020764006">SwapbotNews Tweet about this giveaway</a>. Then, come back here to the blog and comment with a link to your Tweet (click on the time stamp of the Tweet to get a direct link) and your Swap-bot username. Not too complicated, right?</p>

<p>The giveaway will be open for entry through Saturday, June 13th. The winner will be randomly drawn and announced on Sunday, June 14th. If you have trouble commenting on the blog, you can send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. Good luck!</p>

<p>Better late than never, here are the three randomly chosen winners of the March/April Giveaway for Swap-bot t-shirts and other goodies:</p>

<p><strong>Christine Makai aka <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mystic69">mystic69</a>:</strong> <em>“I heard about swapbot from an email buddy…. I just did two swaps (still waiting for my candy bar!) and am finding the experience awesome!”</em></p>

<p><strong>Ellen aka <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ellie1200">ellie1200</a>:</strong> <em>“Ooh! I love to share the story of how I found swap-bot! I’d been searching the web for a crochet pattern. Someone had asked me about making them some “soakers” for cloth diapers (I didn’t even know what those were till I started looking around!). Anyway, somehow I ended up at a swap-bot member’s blog, momwithahook. She didn’t have a soaker pattern, but she did have some pictures of absolutely adorable crocheted stuffies that she’d made for a swap-bot swap. I just had to see what that cuteness was about, clicked a link, and I was hooked!”</em></p>

<p><strong>Robin Rodgers aka <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:biasbabe">biasbabe</a>:</strong> <em>“Wow, were to begin. I ran into the site of Swap-bot over two years ago on doing a search for swaps. The word swaps will take you to alot of places not just here if you know what I mean LoL. I clicked on the site link which had brought me to the main site, and just by seeing all the neat projects that everyone had completed was enough for me to venture on in. That was the first thing that peeked my senses. Then when it said it was a free membership then that really was awesome. I figured if I didn’t like it I would drop out gracefully. Well as you might have guessed it, that was all it took for me to get hooked on this site. many awesome projects and the next best thing to having a real family and a family of wonderful swappers to share my love of crafting, swapping and sewing. What more could I ask for, nothing absolutely nothing.”</em></p>

<p>Congratulations to the winners!! I will be contacting you to get your t-shirt sizes and then I hope to have your prizes mailed out by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Enter to win this great sponsored giveaway from <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">The Ultimate Handmade European Sample Box</a>. Bree from <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">geteurofied.com</a> is launching an all-European, bi-monthly sample box filled with amazing craft samples from independent artists and crafters from all over Europe on December 1st. A sample box is a great way to find out about up and coming indie artists and crafters. They contain full-size samples of handmade goodies made by small, independent businesses. Bree wanted to give Swap-bot users an early chance to win one of the grand opening Get Eurofied sample boxes. Fabulous!</p>

<p>I asked Bree a few questions about herself and <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">geteurofied.com</a> :</p>

<p><strong>How did you come up with the idea of The Ultimate European Handmade Sampler Box?</strong></p>

<p>I had participated in another sampler box for my own <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5563462">etsy shop</a> and had such a great time creating fun samples. I then purchased <a href="http://www.thespottedbox.com/">The Spotted Box</a> and realized all the sellers participating were based in the states. So I thought… let’s get the Europeans on the map! I am an American living in Denmark for the past two years and I am so inspired by all of the great designs here. Just while walking down the street to grab a cup of coffee I am inspired by the European culture. Then…the story begins.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get involved in independent arts and crafts?</strong></p>

<p>I have always been a creative soul. I remember coloring in my Rainbow Brite Coloring Book and designing outfits with my Tomy Fashion Plates. (uh-oh, did I just give away my age?) That then led me to becoming a Wardrobe Stylist after high school and the creative streak has never gone away. After 10 years of fashion, style and design, it is who I am. I also write a <a href="http://www.stylistdiva.com/">fashion blog</a> that’s filled with fab ETSY shops! I love to be able to dig into my craft stash, turn on some great music and let the party begin!</p>

<p><strong>How does the sampler box help independent artists and crafters?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">Get Eurofied</a> is a fantastic way for all of the skilled, independent Europeans to show off their online shops and share their talents with the world. The boxes are filled with handmade items that will show the buyer what kind of quality they will be getting while shopping at each of the participating stores. Once the buyer is enticed by the unique samples it is obvious that they will generate more business.</p>

<p><strong>What types of things will the Get Eurofied sample boxes contain?</strong></p>

<p>Some of the samples are earrings, fabric pouches, brooches, hairpins, necklaces, bookmarks, and MANY more fab surprises! (<a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/Participants.html">Go here</a> to see the current list of Get Eurofied participants.) When I say samples I really mean a “FULL SIZE ITEM – ready to use” for yourself or to give as a gift that you will be proud of giving. These boxes are over the top!</p>

<p>—————-</p>

<p>Would you like to win one of the Get Eurofied sample boxes? Simply answer the following question in the comments section of this post.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite type of item to purchase from independent artists or crafters?</strong></p>

<p>We will draw one lucky winner on Sunday, November 30th. Each person can only enter once. You must have a Swap-bot account in good standing (not suspended) with a valid mailing address to enter. You must include your Swap-bot username somewhere in your comment. (FYI: This prize will be mailed directly from Bree at geteurofied.com. I will provide her with the winner’s mailing info.) You must comment on, or before, Saturday, November 29th, to be entered in the drawing. If you have trouble commenting on the blog, you can send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. Good luck!</p>

<p>If you are not the big winner, don’t fret! You can get your own European Sample Box starting December 1st at <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">geteurofied.com</a>.</p>

<p>The winner of the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/11/09/november-giveaway-enter-to-win/">November Giveaway for the Xyron sticker maker</a> is <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:HeideC">HeideC</a> ! Here is her comment from the entry post about her favorite thing to swap:</p>

<p>“My favorite swaps are one-on-one swaps. I love looking for items based on what someone has on their profile and finding or making just that special thing that</p>

<p>We did the drawing a little bit differently this month since there were so many participants. We basically took out any duplicate comments by the same person, added people who had emailed me, and then used a random number generator on the computer to pick the winner. Not exactly as fun as making Travis draw from a bucket, but still totally random. Cool. Thanks for playing! We have more drawings coming up soon.</p>

This month I have a very cool tool to send to one lucky winner. It is a <a href="http://www.xyron.com/">Xyron</a> sticker maker! Specifically the <a href="http://www.xyron.com/enUS/Products/2_5__create-a-sticker_.html">Xyron 250 2.5” create-a-sticker™</a> . I use my Xyron to create stickers out of all sorts of things, like photos, ribbons, confetti, etc. You simply run any item through the Xyron and it makes the back sticky! Very cool. The Xyron I have for the giveaway comes filled with 20 feet of permanent adhesive. That will last a very long time, but you can purchase refills at most craft stores. (btw, the Xyron company is in no way sponsoring this giveaway, I just really like the product and wanted to give one away… of course, I wouldn’t turn down a sponsored giveaway if any company is interested. hint, hint.)</p>

<p>To enter the drawing for this giveaway simply comment on this blog post with your answer to the following question:</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite thing to swap and why?</strong></p>

<p>Each person can only enter once. You must have a Swap-bot account in good standing (not suspended) with a valid mailing address to enter. You must include your Swap-bot username somewhere in your comment. You must comment before Friday, November 21st, to be entered in the drawing. The winner will be drawn out of a hat/bucket by a blindfolded Travis on Saturday, November 22nd. If you have trouble commenting on the blog, you can send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. Good luck!</p>

<p>We have a winner! This morning I printed out all of the names from the comments that had been posted on the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/10/24/winter-prize-giveaway-enter-to-win/">Winter Prize Giveaway</a> (we had a total of 85 unique entrants). Then, Travis covered his eyes and drew a random paper slip out of our Halloween candy bucket. AND… the winner of the Making Memories prize pack is <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:OniGiri885">Onigiri885</a></p>

<p>! Congrats! This is her comment from the entry post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lela (onigiri885) on 25 Oct 2008 at 8:54 am:</p>

  <p>I think it would be really cool if there was a ‘friend’ system, where you could add people as your friend and have easier ways of contacting them instead of just pm’s or profile messages. ^.^</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will be sending her an email confirming her win and then her package will be mailed next week. I hope she has fun with all those supplies! We are planning on creating a friends system in the near future (as well as a “block user” system), so it was a great suggestion, too. Actually, everyone had wonderful suggestions. Thank you all for your feedback! We hope to implement most of the ideas as quickly as possible. Although, knowing us it will probably take longer than we would like. Stay tuned for site improvements and many more giveaways on the blog! xoxo</p>

<p>Announcing our first Swap-bot giveaway! We wanted to come up with a way to reward our awesome Swap-bot users and make the place a little more fun in the process. We decided to start by doing monthly giveaways of fun prizes. The first giveaway prize features a collection <a href="http://www.makingmemories.com/">Making Memories</a> holiday crafting supplies. Making Memories is basically a scrapbooking brand, but I love to use their embellishments for all sorts of crafts, like matchboxes, greeting cards, collages, etc. One winner of this giveaway will receive the following (brand-spanking-new) goodies:</p>
