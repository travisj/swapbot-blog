		<p>Thank you to everyone who participated in our <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2015/10/30/2015-holiday-gift-donation-drive/">2015 Holiday Gift Donation Drive</a> to benefit <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org">The Partnership for the Homeless</a>! <strong>Together we raised $1,050 in cash and gift card donations and collected more than a dozen toy and gift items.</strong> All of the donations were distributed at the Children’s Holiday Party on December 12th, which served more than 250 local NYC kids.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/childrensholidayparty15.jpg" alt="childrensholidayparty15" width="600" height="805" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17339" /></a></p>

<p>Arnold S. Cohen, President &amp; CEO of The Partnership for the Homeless, sent the following message of thanks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I want to thank you for your generous participation in the year’s Annual Children’s Holiday Party. Thanks to you, the party was a huge success with over 250 children and their families enjoying a day of fun at Genesis Home-Help USA, Brooklyn, NY where they enjoyed great food, crafts, games, and gifts. These photos of the party show the joy and excitement you helped create.</p>

  <p>It’s hard to imagine how precious a fun day is to these families. Many have spent months living in homeless shelters, with none of the familiarity and warmth of home. And others are on the brink of falling into homelessness. The Partnership’s staff at our Family Resource Center is working with these families to get them back into an apartment or working to prevent them from falling into homelessness. They also go beyond immediate needs to assist families in securing the best healthcare and education options for themselves and their children, financial counseling and job development.</p>

  <p>All of us at the Partnership thank you Swap-bot for helping our families experience the support of a community, especially as they face the many challenges in their lives. We look forward to partnering together again for next year’s party.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is great to hear that we helped make the party a success!! Thank you all for your donations and enthusiastic support each year. This is a very special community. Happy 2016!! xoxo</p>

<p>Did you know? <strong>Over 25,000 children are sleeping in New York municipal shelters tonight.</strong></p>

<p>It is that time of year again when we can help brighten the holiday season for some of NYC’s homeless youth. Help us by donating to our <strong>6th Annual Holiday Gift Donation Drive</strong> to benefit <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org">The Partnership for the Homeless</a>!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/redstripe2.gif" alt="redstripe2" width="600" height="29" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11375" /></p>

<p>The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services, support, and advocacy for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate our donation of new, unwrapped gifts and gift cards to be handed out to children at their <strong><a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/childrens-holiday-party">Children’s Holiday Party</a> in Brooklyn on December 12th, 2015</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Message from The Partnership for the Homeless:</strong> _&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Want to help make the holidays a little merrier for children and families who are homeless? Support our Annual Children’s Holiday Party!</p>

  <p>Every December, The Partnership throws a gigantic celebration for over 400 children and families who are struggling with homelessness, providing holiday cheer through food, games, face painting, Santa, and of course — presents!</p>

  <p>Every year we organize a festive holiday celebration for families who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness, providing a much-needed respite from the daily challenges of poverty in some of our city’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods.</p>

  <p>Pulling off a party of this size is no small feat. It takes the hard work and dedication of many staff, sponsors, donors, and dozens of volunteers to make the magic happen.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s put together a huge donation of gifts for The Partnership!!</strong></p>

<p>We can accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $10 or $20 amounts to stores like Target, Barnes and Noble, H&amp;M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Best Buy. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC. <strong>Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless</strong> because they are versatile and good for older kids, but we can also accept new, unwrapped toys, books, and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations. <a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/sponsorship-opportunities/">Read more info about what can be donated here.</a></p>

<p>Send your donations by Friday, December 4th to:</p>

<p>**Rachel Johnson</p>

<p>Swap-bot.com</p>

<p>285 5th Ave PMB 415</p>

<p>Brooklyn, NY 11215**</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/redstripe2.gif" alt="redstripe2" width="600" height="29" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11375" /></p>

<p>And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: <strong>Each Swap-bot member who sends in a donation of a gift card or item will earn the removal of one low (1 or 3) rating from their account!!</strong> You must mail your donation to Swap-bot headquarters (address above) by <strong>Friday, December 4th</strong>. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will receive a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only earn one rating removal credit during this donation drive –- although you are welcome to donate more than one item!</p>

<p><strong>The Fine Print:</strong> <em>All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings — it is not a “free pass” for flaking. Everyone who donates will receive an email from me with the details of the rating removal credit. You can reply to that message any time to “cash in” your credit. I also make a permanent admin note (only visible to admin) on each donor’s account stating that they have a rating removal credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>International option:</strong> If you are unable to purchase appropriate gift cards in your area or ship other gifts, I am willing to accept cash donations via <a href="https://www.paypal.com">Paypal</a>. I will then buy a gift card in your name to donate OR donate the money directly to the Partnership for the Homeless, depending on their greater need. Use the button below to donate OR send Paypal donations to rachel -at- swap-bot.com. (Replace the -at- and spaces with @.) All Paypal donations of $10 or more will count toward a rating removal.</p>

<p><strong>Use this button to donate via Paypal:</strong></p>

<p>I have an awesome announcement… <strong>2014 was our BIGGEST YEAR EVER for our annual Holiday Gift Donation Drive for <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org">The Partnership for the Homeless</a>!!!</strong> We collected even more than during our epic <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2012/12/04/donation-drive-success/">2012 Donation Drive for Hurricane Sandy relief</a>! Wow.</p>

<p><strong>Together we collected:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>$1250 in Paypal and other cash donations. <em>(Half of this money was used to purchase H&amp;M and Old Navy gift cards to give to teens at the <a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/childrens-holiday-party">Children’s Holiday Party</a>, as requested by The Partnership. The other half was given directly to The Partnership to offset the party costs and to generally support their programs.)</em></li>
  <li>$485 in varius other gift cards to places like Target and Barnes &amp; Noble.</li>
  <li>Many hats, gloves, scarves, books, and toys.</li>
  <li><strong>115 Swap-bot members participated in the Donation Drive and our grand total was more than $1735!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I am so impressed with this community’s generosity year after year! <strong>Thank you all so much for your support and participation!</strong></p>

<p>Our lovely Partnership contact, Wanda, came and picked up our box of donations today. Our gifts will make a huge impact at the <a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/childrens-holiday-party">Children’s Holiday Party</a> this Saturday, December 6th. The holiday season will be a little brighter for many of NYC’s homeless youth thanks to you!</p>

<p>Happy, happy holidays! xoxo</p>

<p>Did you know? <strong>Nearly 24,000 children will be sleeping in New York municipal shelters tonight.</strong></p>

<p>It is that time of year again when we can help brighten the holiday season for some of NYC’s homeless youth. Help us by donating to our <strong>5th Annual Holiday Gift Donation Drive</strong> to benefit the <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org">Partnership for the Homeless</a>!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/redstripe2.gif" alt="redstripe2" width="600" height="29" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11375" /></p>

<p><strong>Message from The Partnership for the Homeless:</strong> _&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We thank you for your past support and look forward to your continued sponsorship as we put on our annual Holiday Party for these children and their families. The afternoon will be magical for these children with music, games, crafts, face painters, tasty food and a picture with Santa. We hope that this will result in an abundance of laughter. The need for funding remains — we need to defray the costs for items like food, entertainment and transportation for the children and their families.</p>

  <p>We hope to send each child home with toys, games, clothes and books, but more importantly, a smile from ear to ear. These “gifts from Santa” are only possible through donations, toy drives and the generous spirit of contributors like you. As a non-profit, we need people like you to help us make this a special afternoon.</p>

  <p>I hope we can count on your participation once again during these tough times. Thank you for your support and wishing you a happy holiday season filled with warmth, health and happiness.</p>

<p>It is holiday time! And that means we are once again hosting a donation drive to benefit <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5">The Partnership for the Homeless</a>.</p>

<p>You may remember our <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/01/19/final-winter-donation-drive-update/">hat and scarf drive in 2010</a>, the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/12/05/holiday-donation-drive-update/">holiday gift drive in 2011</a>, and the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2012/12/04/donation-drive-success/">Hurricane Sandy relief drive last year</a>. The Swap-bot community has done a lot of good over the last few years… let’s keep it up! <strong>This year, we will be collecting holiday gifts for NYC’s homeless children.</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/redstripe2.gif" alt="redstripe2" width="600" height="29" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10846" /></p>

<p><strong>Did you know that more than 20,000 children live in New York City shelters?</strong> The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services and support for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate our donation of unwrapped gifts and gift cards to be handed out to children at their <strong><a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/news/entry/help-brighten-the-holidays-for-a-child-in-a-shelter/">Children’s Holiday Party on December 14th</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s put together a huge donation of gifts for The Partnership!!</strong></p>

<p>We can accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $10 or $20 amounts to stores like Target, Barnes and Noble, H&amp;M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Best Buy. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC. Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless, but we can also accept unwrapped toys and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations. <a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/sponsorship-opportunities/">Read more info about what can be donated here.</a></p>

<p>Send your donations by December 6th to:</p>

<p>**Rachel Johnson</p>

<p>Swap-bot.com</p>

<p>285 5th Ave PMB 415</p>

<p>Brooklyn, NY 11215**</p>

<p>And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: <strong>Each Swap-bot member who sends in a donation of a gift card or item will earn the removal of one low (1 or 3) rating from their account!!</strong> You must mail your donation to Swap-bot headquarters (address above) by <strong>December 6th</strong>. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will receive a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only have one rating removed during this donation drive – although you are welcome to donate more than one item! (All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings — it is not a “free pass” for flaking.)</p>

<p><strong>International option:</strong> If you are unable to purchase appropriate gift cards in your area or ship other gifts, I am willing to accept cash donations via <a href="https://www.paypal.com">Paypal</a>. I will then buy a gift card in your name to donate. Use the button below or send Paypal donations to rachel -at- swap-bot.com. (Replace the -at- and spaces with @.) All Paypal donations of $10 or more will count toward a rating removal.</p>

<p>Hurricane Sandy hit our community, New York City, and all of the the East Coast region very hard. People are hurting. Homes and businesses and lives have been lost. We want to help those in need. Want to join us?</p>

<p>For this year’s Swap-bot holiday charity drive, let’s donate to Hurricane Sandy Recovery efforts via the Red Cross. I’ve set up a <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/swapbot4sandy"><strong>Swap-bot 4 Sandy Crowdrise campaign</strong></a>. Financial donations can be made by major credit card and help the Red Cross provide shelter, food, emotional support and other assistance to those affected by disasters like Hurricane Sandy.</p>

<p>Like in our past holiday donation drives, there is an extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: <strong>Each Swap-bot member who donates to our <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/swapbot4sandy/">Crowdrise campaign</a>&lt;/a&gt; (or by one of the alternative donation options below) will get one low (1 or 3) rating removed from their account!!</strong></p>

<p>If you would prefer to donate a gift or winter gear to <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/">The Partnership for the Homeless</a> Children’s Holiday Party, I am accepting those donations, too.

<p>I’ve just learned that this year’s <a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/news/entry/childrens-holiday-party1/">Children’s Holiday Party</a> put on by the Partnership for the Homeless was the biggest ever. The success of the event was in part thanks to the generosity of you, the Swap-bot community. Nearly 500 children attended the event at the Brooklyn Children’s museum and all received gifts — which included the gift cards and winter items that were donated by our site members as part of our <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/12/05/holiday-donation-drive-update/">Winter Gift Donation Drive</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you to all who participated in the donation drive!</strong> Hopefully, we can do something similar next year…</p>

<p>It is that time of year again: we are co-hosting another donation drive with <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5">The Partnership for the Homeless</a>. You may remember that <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/11/29/donation-drive-for-the-partnership-for-the-homeless/">last year</a> we collected more than <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/01/19/final-winter-donation-drive-update/">325 hats, sets of gloves, and scarves for the winter gear drive</a>! Awesome! This year, we will be collecting gifts for NYC’s homeless children.</p>

<p><strong>Did you know that nearly 15,000 children live in New York City shelters?</strong> The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services and support for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate a donation of gift cards to be handed out to older children at their <strong>Children’s Holiday Party on December 10th</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>That is where the fantastic Swap-bot community comes in! Let’s put together a huge donation of gifts for The Partnership!!</strong></p>

<p>We can accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $5 to $10 amounts to stores like AMC theaters, Barnes and Noble, H&amp;M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Target. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC.

<p>Did you know that as of October 2010, there were over 35,000 people–including over 8,000 families and over 14,000 children–in New York City shelters? That is a staggering number and it makes me want to help, if even in a small way…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5">The Partnership for the Homeless</a> is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services and support for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate a donation of hats, scarves, and gloves/mittens this winter.</p>

<p><strong>That is where the fantastic Swap-bot community comes in! Let’s put together a huge donation of warm weather gear for The Partnership!!</strong></p>

<p>And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: <strong>Each Swap-bot member who mails me a donation of one winter item will get one low (1 or 3) rating removed from their account!!</strong> You must mail your donation to Swap-bot headquarters (address below) by January 10th. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will get a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only get one rating removed during this donation drive – although you are welcome to donate more than one item! We have discussed doing a rating removal program like this in the past and now seems like a great time to try it out. The plan is to make this an annual program, so that in theory, each member could get one rating removed each year by donating to the chosen charity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5">The Partnership for the Homeless</a> needs hats, gloves, and scarves for all ages, from infants to adults, and they accept both <strong>new</strong> handmade and <strong>new</strong> store bought items. Send your donation to:</p>

<p>**Rachel Johnson</p>

<p>Swap-bot.com</p>

<p>285 5th Ave PMB 415</p>

<p>Brooklyn, NY 11215**</p>

<p>All donations must be received by January 10th, 2011. As soon as I receive your donation, I will contact you about which rating you would like removed from your account. Be sure to include your username and email address with your donation. I will be delivering our donations to <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5">The Partnership for the Homeless</a> office on January 17th.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions…. Let’s put together a huge donation from Swap-bot!!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> All ratings removed in exchange for a hat, scarf, or glove donation will need to be six months old at the time of removal. That will make it more difficult for future low ratings to be removed through this system, and will give swappers plenty of time to work out situations with their partners. (That being said, I am willing to look at unique situations that may warrant a quicker rating forgiveness – especially for those who have already donated before this change was announced.)</p>

<p>I am sure that there may be a few scenarios in which swappers could still take advantage of this opportunity, but I think that the six month waiting period will discourage nearly everyone from simply choosing not to send a swap. And hopefully, even with the waiting period this rating forgiveness/donation option will help some people escape an unfair low rating that has been hanging around tarnishing their record while helping NYC homeless at the same time.</p>
