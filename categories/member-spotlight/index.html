<p>————</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MissThundercat">MissThundercat</a>!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> The Netherlands</p>

<p>I am not going to say that I saved the best for last (because I think all of our Ambassadors are the best!) but MissThundercat is definitely a very special Swap-bot member and Ambassador. She is an Original Member who has been swapping on the ‘bot since March of 2007. She has completed more that 500 swaps and often posts about Swap-bot and snail mail on social media. A truly avid snail mailer and crafter, she loves hand-carving stamps, coloring, calligraphy with fountain pens, ATCs, and many other types of art and crafts. MissThundercat holds a special place in my heart because in 2010 I had the privilege of <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/06/17/swapper-meet-ups/">meeting her in real life while she was visiting NYC</a> — such fun!!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MissThundercat"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cheetarah.png" alt="Cheetarah" width="600" height="571" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15568" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cheetarah-300x286.png 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cheetarah.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>

<p><strong>How MissThundercat found Swap-bot:</strong> “I found swapbot through a friend of mine on flickr who introduced me to matchbox swaps.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I’ve met a lot of fun people through Swap-bot, and met a few of them in real life, as well. A recent one is my friend <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Orit">Orit</a> from Israel, I met last year in October. And that’s the main reason why I love swapbot, it brings a lot of crafty people together on and off line.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “I love doing themed swaps, especially Matchbox swaps, ATC’s, and Mail Art (I did a <a href="http://mailart365.blogspot.nl/search/label/Miss%20Thundercat">365 Mail art project</a> in 2012/2013 and sent out many RAKs to swapbot members through a signup in the forums). Crafty swaps are my favorite kind. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/miss_thundercat/5731574206/in/set-72157601419616865">This is one of the fave things I’ve sent</a> — combining my love for stamp carving and matchbox swaps.”</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KateKintail">KateKintail</a>!</strong> KateKintail lives in Virginia and is a serious fangirl. She loves all sorts of scifi and fantasy — like Star Trek, Supernatural, Lord of the Rigs, Harry Potter (a proud Hufflepuff!), etc — and she makes awesome crafts and swap packages around the themes. (Like this giant <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/katekintail/9039503732/in/photolist-eLMPwC-eLMPwj-iLyfEd-fCZ9hX-fDgHmY-fCZ8UR-eg139B-fCZ9vD-fCZ9rc-nLenGR-nKGa6m-eg13aa-nNiDtT-nu2EvE-iMukXi-nwtUeC-iLsNjr-eg6Mr5-nJsQYW-nLcKVT-nto1ns-iMukqX-nJsidm-iLyfow-fDgHGu-nQKLdF-iLwL4N-iLw3Nu-dopF3Q-nLVBMQ-eeAMrF-bDNvXB-ntobKJ-dQ9Qqs-iMukeV-eg6Mnj-nwtAaQ-nQKLdR-iLuz8w-iLu4TZ-iLuzJS-bh5YQH-d3aZVL-d3b3Do-bh5JfZ-iMu4UB-nJsiCu-bqTyMG-e5S7r8-bqTB1W">Star Trek swap</a> and this amazing <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/katekintail/14279437814/in/photolist-nKPRnG-ntnvDM-nHPHVw-nHPHSq-ntnvyX-ntmZvj-nKRzVB-nKRzWi-nKywoM-ntmZs3-nMD56g-ntnbt3-nHP9Dw-ntnbqC-nKyweZ-ntmWsg-nKRzEX-iMwd4B-iMwd7c-iMyXib-iMyX7E-iMwcCB-iMyWN3-iMyWMm-iMyWHy-iMyWzN-iMwcbp-iMwPU5-iMuVwT-iMuVsV-iMwbLM-iMwPvu-iMwbCk-iMyW1b-iMwPpY-iMwbpe-iMyVKm-iMwP9h-iMwb6t-iMyVwL-iMyVoQ-iMwNHC-iMuUmB-iMwNBA-iMyUZU-iMuUec-iMwavv-iMwNcN-iMwNay-iMwacV">Geordi LaForge peep</a>. I’m in love!) She is a vegetarian and a collector of postcards and all things Eeyore. She is also an avid reader and writer.</p>

<p><strong>How KateKintail found Swap-bot:</strong> ” I got a Swap-bot postcard in my goodie bag at the international BookCrossing Convention 2011. My friend <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:melydia">melydia</a> did swap-bot and was always raving about it. I hadn’t crafted in a while so I wasn’t sure it was for me. Once I got the postcard in the bag I decided to take a look. I poked around and was hooked! Melydia was actually the one who emailed me and told me I should apply to be an Ambassador (so she sort of is one already!).”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “There’s something for everyone, even people like me with a billion interests can find a home. I’ve learned so much from other swappers -— not just techniques and new crafts, but friendships and advice. There’s always something fun going on somewhere on Swap-bot, and if you don’t see something you like you can make a new swap! I love seeing the creativity of others and being inspired to try something new or refine my skills. I also like having deadlines to work toward and I like the accountability aspect. I love getting things people have written or created, but even more than that I love creating things that will put smiles on my partners’ faces!”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “I’m a fangirl at heart, so anything to do with my favorite books/tv/movies. I’m partial to whimsy jars as my favorite craft.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I painted my craft room light purple like my childhood bedroom wall color. When I’m at home or not sleeping, you will almost always find me in my craft room—it’s where the laptop and gluesticks live (though they are located across the room from each other)!”</li>
  <li>“When not at home crafting or writing, I hunt down historical markers with my trusty stuffed sidekick Eeyore and log them on <a href="http://markeroni.com">Markeroni.com</a>.”&lt;/ul&gt;</li>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:susieq11">susieq11</a>!</strong> Susieq11 is a New Jersey native who now lives in Ohio. She is an extremely avid snail mail lover, sending out post nearly everyday! She also loves poodles (she has two) and Snoopy.</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Columbus, Ohio, USA</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/susieq11.png" alt="susieq11" width="600" height="850" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12617" /></p>

<p><strong>How susieq11 found Swap-bot:</strong> “I was introduced to swap-bot by a friend in 2010. Once I saw it, I thought: WHERE WERE YOU ALL OF MY LIFE!? I have been a letter writer since I was about 8 or 9 — starting with letters from camp or to my relatives. Then I had pen-pals all over. I was always writing to “Big Blue Marble” as they paired you with pen pals! I am dating myself as a 70’s and early 80’s kid, ha ha! Several of my best friends were made via pen-palling. I even have a couple that I met from friendship books in the 80’s — and at 40+, we are still friends in real life! I have a pen pal in Finland that is one of my best friends. We started to write in high school and have met. I have met several swap-bot people too: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:rexypants">Rexypants</a> and I have dubbed ourselves “twins” (shhh!). She lives in Vancouver and we have met a couple of times. Once in Seattle and then last year I flew out to visit her in BC! We iMessage waaaaayyy too much and keep USPS and Canada Post in business! <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:maxbenleo">Maxbenleo</a> and I are great friends and we have an annual tradition of meeting in Florida every summer now! She and her family visit each year from Germany and this July will be our second visit! I have met people locally, too. I write to a lot of people regularly, we connect on Facebook and whatsapp, etc. I swear we need a worldwide convention to meet up with swap-botters from everywhere!”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “See above!!!! OMG, it is so much fun!!!! I love the connections, even on an acquaintance level. So nice to have a community of fun people that you can share with. I love to set up swaps and it’s exciting to wait and see who your partners are! I love RAKs as I love to share my finds with people — and make their day by surprising them. This gives me a fun outlet for snail mail and new connections.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “Postcards, yes!! I am a crazy postcard lady…like cat ladies, but just postcards. My third bedroom is my postcard collection’s home! But so is part of my bedroom, ha ha! I also love note cards, used stamps, scavenger hunts, mail art, and anything paper related!”</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://swap-bot.com/user:dolcxvita">dolcxvita</a>!</strong> Dolcxvita is originally from India, but she now lives in Singapore. She has traveled all over Asia and has also lived in the UK. She is an avid snail mail lover and a designer who enjoys experimenting with all types of art and crafts.</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> India &amp; Southeast Asia</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dolcxvita.png" alt="dolcxvita" width="322" height="333" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12247" /><strong>How dolcxvita found Swap-bot:</strong> “A few years ago, I inherited a large collection of postcards addressed to my mother, written by various people who were on their journeys far and wide. To a lot of people, it would be a box of junk from the 60’s. They would be perfectly happy communicating via Skype, Whatsapp and other social networks. But to me, I was more than thrilled to open the box, inspect the contents and read each card which seemed to magically transport me not only to the date and place of its origin, but also to my mothers childhood – something I have always been curious about. So that is when my love for snail mail began, I wanted a box of my own, perhaps to pass on to my daughter or perhaps to one day, open it and read something from twenty years ago – it would sort of be a time capsule, where unlike in a photo or video, this would allow the viewer a creative license to use their imagination a little more! I was studying in the UK at that time and I convinced my family and friends to write to me – real mail, long letters, beautiful postcards, birthday cards etc. began filling up my mailbox.”</p>

<p>“Three years ago, I stumbled across swap-bot, while looking for postcards (I also stumbled upon an International Postcard Show in Nottingham UK – where I ended up exhibiting my work – must have been my lucky day!) Anyway, what a wonderful thing – this website! Here I could not only exchange postcards with people from all over the world, but take this whole creative correspondence thing to a new level. I still remember the rush of excitement when stepping into an art store after a very long time and buying basic supplies to make my first ATC and then making dozens more with the help of some amazing supplies I received from swaps.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I moved back to India and the little boxes of exciting goodies continued to fly in and out of my home, my puzzled family wondered what was going on. But when I shared with them, candy from London, vintage toys from Madrid, laughs from Melbourne, experiences from New York, travel tips from Moscow, art from Japan, Xmas ornaments from Finland — their amusement gave way to excitement – which now takes over every time I receive a parcel.”</p>

<p>“Swap-Bot combined my love for travel and art. It helped me see places I had never seen before, through the eyes of the people I had never met before and no matter what path I choose, I know that I have found a door into a creative space where I can write, make and learn and share all of it, whenever I want.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “I love ATC and postcard swaps, but I feel like I hit a jackpot every time I learn something new about another country – be it in the from a physical souvenir or a book recommendation or random fact on a postcard or a piece of fabric showcasing traditional art.”</p>

<p><strong>Fun Facts about <a href="http://swap-bot.com/user:dolcxvita">dolcxvita</a>:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“I am 20-somehting, recently married, marketing consultant and graphic designer.”</li>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:grimmlynn">grimmlynn</a>!</strong> Grimmlynn lives near Birmingham, Alabama, and has been swapping on Swap-bot for more than six years. She loves crafting and has a pet Uromastyx (a type of lizard) and four cats.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/grimmlynn.png" alt="grimmlynn" width="229" height="229" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12176" /><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Alabama, USA</p>

<p><strong>How grimmlynn found Swap-bot:</strong> “I found Swap-bot while on <a href="http://www.craftster.org">Craftster.org</a>. Someone wanted to swap with me and suggested we “make it official” on Swap-bot, so I was introduced to your site and instantly fell in love with swapping. ”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I enjoy Swap-bot because it allows me to connect with other people, while at the same time expressing my creativity. In other words, I can make a new friend AND exchange something fun. It’s a wonderful way to inspire me to create, as well. I would not craft nearly as much if not for Swap-bot. It inspires me with new ideas, new techniques, and new materials.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite type of swap would probably be Inchies. I love making them and have been collecting them for a really long time. They are super fun to make and don’t really take up a lot of space to collect and can be displayed in really neat ways. I am also really into making matchboxes,which, by the way, are the perfect size for including a few inchies. I also like challenge type swaps, where you have to find certain things for your partner, vintage/thrift store swaps and really all types of swaps. I’ve never met a swap I didn’t like.”</p>

<p><strong>Fun Facts about <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:grimmlynn">grimmlynn</a>:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“I recently gave my first rally speech to a crowd of over 100 people. It was the single hardest type of speaking I have ever done, but I would definitely do it again.”</li>
  <li>“I decided that I would give making an ATC a serious try for a swap because I liked the theme so much, so I made two Macbeth ones and loved the way they turned out. I’m afraid it’s the start of a new addiction!”</li>

<p>————</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:hollycm6">hollycm6</a>!</strong> Hollycm6 is from Chesapeake, Virginia, and she is an enthusiastic Swap-bot lover. She has been married to her husband, Mark (seen below), for thirty years, and has four children. She is an avid, positive, and friendly swapper who loves trying all types of art swaps.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hollycm6.jpg" alt="hollycm6" width="600" height="473" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11994" /></p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Virginia, USA</p>

<p><strong>How hollycm6 found Swap-bot:</strong> “A few summers ago I participated in a summer art camp that my children’s art teacher was offering. We were to learn how to make an altered book, which was a totally new idea to me. I’ve always done a bit of painting or drawing and loved crafty things, but most of my crafting centered around things my kids or other people needed. This was just for me, and was so much fun! The teacher introduced us to ATCs the first day… When he saw they interested me he suggested I look at a site called Swap-bot, where he traded them with people from around the world. I set up my account thinking as soon as the class was over I’d never look at it again (hence the very boring moniker) but within a short time i was completely addicted.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “Through Swap-bot I have been exposed to so many different ideas, and have tried art techniques and crafts I’d never even have thought of on my own, let alone been courageous enough to attempt with no instruction. It has really opened up a whole world to me, and I discovered and developed my inner artist here, as well as forging some really deep bonds with people all around the world. I’ve been intrigued and excited meeting so many different types of people… Learning how different cultures are but how similar even very different people can be. I’ve loved learning about the way people live, what they think is important, their religion, their daily lives… I even discovered ways to help other people find a smile or two through other organizations that people here suggested, sending cards and letters to chemo patients, soldiers, and elderly people who just need to know someone cares.”</p>

<p>“I always knew I loved mail, but i never knew mail ART. It has amazed me how much I love sending pretty or unusual mail to people. It is lovely to receive a really special, well thought out, handcrafted package from someone… It’s great to open the mailbox and see happy mail staring back at me… But it’s nothing like the feeling of creating and sending such a parcel out into the world!! I have even been told by people around the world that their postal workers have commented on how it brightens their day to pass some of these packages on, and by my postal workers here, so I think about all the people along the way that might be touched or inspired by the right package. We can never know what the slightest small gesture will mean to someone, whether it is the recipient of the gesture or a witness to it, so we should make as many small gestures of love as possible. It isn’t always possible to do large, great things, but a small thing is always something we can do.”</p>

<p>“My experiences on Swap-bot ARE what have helped me see that I am an artist, and that I have something to offer. Daily I develop skill and confidence in myself and my art. (Which in the end will make me a better wife and mother, too.)”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite swaps involve mail art, fun postage, drawing or painting, literature related things, interpreting a theme, or some type of challenge. I have loved developing proficiency in areas where I am comfortable, but also have surprised myself attempting things I never thought I’d try on my own. We even have some swaps that simply try to stretch us individually. Not just as an artist, which so many of them do, but personally… We do things that help us to be grateful, to see the good in life, to enjoy a quiet moment, to practice self control or self discipline, to stop complaining and start speaking encouragement, to lose weight or eat better or clean up our homes when we don’t feel we have time for any if it. The idea of a swap site sounds so trivial, so small, until you really contemplate what can be accomplished when several ladies join together (virtually) working towards goals, or how a single word or smile can change the course of someone’s day.”</p>

<p><em>“My very first attempt at Altered Text Art for an Art On the Written Page swap. (This gave me the confidence to try the following journal swap.) And a Postcard for an Excellent Endings swap (had to include the last line of a book.)”</em></p>

<p><strong>Fun Facts about hollycm6:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“My sister and I are married to brothers. (I think that’s interesting!) our kids spent every holiday together when they were growing up. It was great.”</li>
  <li>“I was born in England and have always wanted to go back. We left when I was only two, so I had no memories of it, and I’ve lived in Hampton Roads [Virginia] since I was four. Recently my husband took me to England — It was literally the best 12 days ever. SO exciting, yet quiet, too. We had so much fun together. So beautiful, and it felt like home to me. And what did I want to do first? In each city I wanted to visit the post office (just to know what it felt like), examine the doors and windows and mail boxes of the city… Then I bought stamps, and mailed things… All swap-bot folks understand that feeling.”
    <ul>
      <li>“I think London is my favorite city ever… But St. Ives is the most beautiful of places, and so sweet. My brother-in-law is an artist there, and seeing his studio was amazing. But nothing could top my bare feet in the cold sand, hugging my coat around me, standing beneath another perfect rainbow and listening to the ocean. London has my heart but St. Ives might have my spirit.</li>
      <li>“I like fortune cookie fortunes, pets, children, puddles, and ferris wheels.I’m much more enamored of a dandelion than a rose (though roses are sweet, too.) I’d like to ride an elephant and to illustrate a children’s book. I hope when I leave this earth that people might say ‘she made me smile’ and be happy that I’d lived.”&lt;/ul&gt;

<p><strong>Fun Fact about grandmaroro:</strong></p>

<p>“This photo is of my “Whatzit Garden” inspired by one I saw in Temple, Texas. The idea is to add only found items from our property, donated items from my children, and marked-down items from Goodwill or garage sales, preferably items not costing more than $2.00 for any one item.”</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Dyp">dyp</a>!</strong> Dyp lives lives in a place close to my heart: Kansas City, Missouri. (I grew up there!) She is a <a href="http://www.kchenna.com">henna artist</a> who has been a member of Swap-bot since 2008. She loves swapping ATCs.</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Missouri, USA</p>

<p><strong>How dyp found Swap-bot:</strong> “I joined a craft bag swap that went through Swap-bot in 2008. After several years I rediscovered Swap-bot to trade ATCs on.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “The ease of use. Joining swaps, sending swaps and rating users is intuitive and seemless. I have joined other groups for swapping ATCs and the rating system is deplorable, tracking swaps is non existent. Swap-bot by far is the easiest to use.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “Hand drawn ATCs”</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:thebragal">thebragal</a>!</strong> Thebragal lives near Toronto in Ontario, Canada. She is the mother of three boys and loves paper crafting.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/thebragal.png" alt="thebragal" width="300" height="300" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11566" /><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Ontario, Canada</p>

<p><strong>How thebragal found Swap-bot:</strong> “I don’t remember exactly where but I remember reading on a crafting blog that someone had made their creation for a swap and I was intrigued. I also saw Swap-Bot featured in a magazine.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “Swap-Bot gives me exciting ideas that help me create. I have so many stamps and papers now that it can be overwhelming to focus and pick what to work on. Joining swaps stretches my creativity and helps me focus by giving me ideas of what to make. I’d never made a zine, matchbox ,or mixed media journal before Swap-Bot. A lot of the time I am way more excited by creating the project than I am about what I will receive. But when I get fun mail several times a week, it really makes my day. I am at home a lot as a SAHM and because of several disabilities I don’t get out much and can’t work. So, Swap-Bot gives me so much in just an envelope!”</p>

<p>“I also get a chance to meet amazing people from all over the world and have cultivated many friendships. It’s an opportunity to stretch myself as a leader and teacher when I host, creating innovative swaps using new techniques and ideas. I did a whole series on different techniques for my group, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/0c1d0f543c1421ee85993396667d59d1/about">Spoiled Swappers</a>. SS is just one of several groups I’ve been founder or officer for, contributing by hosting swaps, checking ratings and more. I am always eager to try new things and think up new ideas when hosting swaps with a goal of helping others think outside the box when they create. Swap-Bot gives me a place to do that!”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “I love to make and swap greeting cards, matchboxes and tags and I have a fondness in my heart for Q&amp;A email swaps. I can’t resist them! I hosted 100 Crafty Questions and drafted every question myself. I was super excited that it hit #1 in the Top Swaps!”</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact about thebragal:</strong></p>

<p>“When I started out by rubber stamping and making cards I PROMISED hubby I would never get into scrapbooking because there were way too many supplies to buy and those ladies were a bit crazy! This is back when my supplies would fit into a medium-sized box! I had no idea how much I could spend on stamps and card making or how many products are the same or cross-over. I now scrapbook and have most of a room plus an overflow storage room in the basement dedicated to crafting. Oops! Now I am 100%, and quite happily I might add, THAT crazy lady!”</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:BeeMGee">BeeMGee</a>!</strong> BeeMGee lives in Victor Harbor in South Australia, and is a mother and school teacher. She has been swapping on Swap-bot for more than two years and loves paper crafting.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BeeMGeeSmall.png" alt="BeeMGeeSmall" width="200" height="282" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11558" /><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Australia</p>

<p><strong>How BeeMGee found Swap-bot:</strong> “I found Swap bot when a Facebook swap for a valentine card became too big and the organizers asked to join swap-bot.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I belong to many groups on Swap-bot and host a regional group here in Australia (Vintage Cards and Crafts – Australia). I participate in several group forums and have made lifelong friends who, sadly, I shall probably never meet in person. I log in to swap-bot several times a day.”</p>

<p>“I consider Swap-bot to be a fantastic site to swap on particularly because of the rating system and inbuilt controls. I belong to several facebook sites where there is no accountability and people are left disappointed with being unable to have some guarantee they will receive a swap.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “I mainly swap Type 3 swaps – ATCs, cards, tags, rolos.”</p>

<p><strong>Her motivation for crafting:</strong> “I find crafting incredibly therapeutic… I love creating, but designing and producing for myself would be pointless. I love the thought of bringing joy to others. That thrill of receiving an addressed envelope and wondering what treasures are enclosed. I know this may sound trite but I am more interested in giving to others than receiving. Of course, I love what I am sent, but hope I am able to bring a little happiness into others’ lives. The benefit of receiving from others has been the wonderful techniques I have learned from them, and of course, their work is inspirational in future swaps.”</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:LauraAust">LauraAust</a>!</strong> LauraAust lives near Des Moines, Iowa, and she has been swapping on Swap-bot for more than four years. She is nearing one thousand 5 ratings and she loves rainbows and bubbles!</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Iowa, USA</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/LauraAust.jpg" alt="LauraAust" width="300" height="443" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11460" /></p>

<p><strong>How LauraAust found Swap-bot:</strong> “I was wanting to swap inchies and found Swap-Bot while looking for a way to do just that.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I enjoy ‘meeting’ all of the people and interacting with them. Some of them are so nice! I have met a couple in real life – that was very exciting. I can say that I have found couple of my NEW best friends on Swap-Bot. I am co-founder of <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/d1de56876f9785efec84e2d0744194e8/about">REACH FOR SUCCESS</a> and it’s great to see how supportive members can be! Swap-Bot has encouraged me to try a few new things. And, it always seems I can find a swap in which I wish to participate – if not, I just create one myself!”</p>

<p>“Before Swap-Bot I had never heard of Kawaii – now I have a pretty impressive collection. I also learned about Zentangles here!”</p>

<p>“I enjoy trying to help out others when they are looking for items, products, or needing help / input / advice on a project. I really like turning people on to new crafts – I recently got my Swap-Bot friend addicted to paper / foundation piecing (quilting)! Yay!! I like to consider myself a ‘helper’ although others call me an ‘enabler’.”</p>

<p>“I also love that we can help each other out in daily life issues like depression, death of a family member, child raising issues, etc.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “It varies on the day! I used to do a lot of ATCs, inchies and twinchies, rolos – mostly paper crafts. Then I was doing some crocheting swaps. I love to swap fabric! Lately I have been doing monthly weight loss journals. I also really like to do private swaps when I see something on someone’s profile or Flickr that is incredible – usually I can find something to swap with them to get it! For example, I once crocheted a “naked” doll for my partner to accessorize – in trade she made watercolor paintings of my four cats. I’ve also sent a large crocheted afghan in exchange for a Blythe doll (I named her Meredith and she sits on our TV stand).”</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I was a finalist in a Better Homes and Gardens Patchwork and Quilting design contest in 2001 – the theme was “State Fair”. My quilt toured the country for a year and I got my name in the magazine and a photo of my quilt on their website. I also got a really nice box of prizes valued at $250+.”</li>
  <li>“I own enough quilting fabric to open my own shop (but continue to add to it).” (See photo below!)</li>

<p><strong>How TheWhiteSquirrel found Swap-bot:</strong> “I truly just stumbled upon it while searching online for some sort of pen pal site one day (and SO happy I did).”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I adore Swap-bot….Mail gives me a chance to travel and open my world to learn new things from the comfort of my own home. I get to meet such wonderful people who, despite our differences, all share a common interest — Post! It’s such an inspiration and an outlet for creativity that gives us all a chance to lift ones spirits. Each new swap I sign up for is a new challenge that keeps me going. There are days when I simply don’t know what I would do without these connections — I just love it so.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “Type 3! Thought, care &amp; a little effort goes a long way with me. I really enjoy swapping Mail Art — it’s my favorite. I love to see other people’s creations and read their stories. (I imagine what their life is like and step into their world for a brief moment.) I also trade tea often, chocolate from time to time, coins/currency, and am thrilled with anything Air Mail related or anything covered in postage stamps!”</p>

<p><strong>How Aankee found Swap-bot:</strong> “I first heard of Swap-bot many years ago in an interview you gave on Sister Diane’s <a href="http://www.craftypod.com">CraftyPod</a> podcast. Back then, I was an active Postcrosser and Swap-bot sounded fun, so eventually I joined! Now, I’m an absolute Swap-bot convert, because it’s a fun and diverse place and there’s so much more to do than exchange postcards!”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “My favourite aspect of Swap-bot is the opportunity to share my crafty creations with others, try out new things, get feedback and advice from more expert artists, meet like-minded people, experience the kindness of strangers… and many more!”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite swaps are postcard, letter, and drawing swaps. I haven’t participated in millions of swaps, as I believe in quality over quantity. However, I would be excited to participate in one-to-one swaps, and send out German ephemera.”</p>

<p><strong>Interesting fact about Aankee:</strong> “I have lived in a European, an African and an Asian capital city, by the beach in France and in a manor house in the English country side, and yet my favourite place on earth is my parent’s patio.”</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:moonlightlaura">moonlightlaura</a>!</strong> Moonlightlaura has been a member of Swap-bot since the beginning of 2013. She has done nearly one hundred swaps and makes really awesome crafts inspired by our cute logo mascot, Ernie the Envie. (<a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2013/10/29/ernie-is-ready-for-halloween/">Check out her Franken-Ernie made for a Halloween swap last year.</a>)</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/moonlightlaura.png" alt="moonlightlaura" width="331" height="454" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11290" /><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Southern Region, USA</p>

<p><strong>Info about moonlightlaura’s region:</strong> “I describe Louisiana as a hot and humid place to live, with a lot of diversity. Some people have a southern accent, but others don’t, like myself. We have swamps, marshes, and bayous. I live by Bayou Teche.</p>

<p>When it rains bad it becomes flooded around the areas closest to it. Thankfully we are not close enough to get flooded! We also have hurricane season between June 1 and November 30. Every few years we will get hit, but our area hasn’t been hit since 2008 when Gustav and Ike hit us within a week apart in September. In the winter it can get cold, last winter (2012) we didn’t have much of a winter, but this year (2013) we had freezing temps almost every day. We also had several road closures due to ice being on the bridges and roads.</p>

<p>The food here is great, although I don’t eat most of it. Even though I was born and raised in Louisiana, I was never raised on a lot of the food everyone here loves so much. I do love beignets though! I would have to say that is one of my favorite foods from here.</p>

<p>The rest of the south is pretty much the same weather wise to Louisiana, and the southern region is not very mountainous. It is mostly flat land, and most of the southern states has the Gulf of Mexico as a body of water for their shores.”</p>

<p><strong>How she found Swap-bot:</strong> “I think I came upon Swap-Bot by clicking on a banner on <a href="http://www.postcrossing.com">postcrossing.com</a>. I love sending and receiving postcards on there. My postcard collection has grown since joining.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I enjoy Swap-bot because I have been able to swap with many people who are very talented with their crafting, and also I was able to get many things I could not get where I live. It is fun to join swaps and receive great packages.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite types of swaps are the sticker swaps, the kawaii swaps, the moving along excess swaps and the Ernie the Envie swaps.”</p>

<p><strong>Check out one of moonlightlaura’s Ernie-inspired swaps:</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/moonlightlaura2.png" alt="moonlightlaura2" width="600" height="561" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11291" /></p>

<p>“Made for the Ernie the Envie Holiday Happiness swap, it is a box painted in winter colors (blue and white) with a plastic canvas Ernie on top of the box. It also has snowflake stickers on the sides and glow in the dark glitter mixed with blue glitter paint so the box will glow.”</p>

<p><strong>Interesting fact about moonlightlaura:</strong> “I am also an avid photographer. I love taking pics of things, especially of my cats and of the aircrafts we paint at work.”</p>

<p><strong>How Lanie found Swap-bot:</strong> “I think it was through a thread on Etsy but not 100% sure as it was like 4 years ago.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I love it because it’s easy to use, you meet lots of great people and you get to share your talents with them.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “I like swaps where I can really use my talents and make things to send to others. Sometimes though I don’t always get the same effort in return but at least the person tried. ”</p>

<p>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mag">mag</a>! Mag has been a member of Swap-bot since 2007 and she has completed more than 260 swaps. Wow! She loves crafting and exploring the world and other cultures through snail mail.</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Singapore <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo.jpg" alt="photo" width="325" height="217" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11270" /></p>

<p><strong>How mag found Swap-bot:</strong> “I remember in 2007, before I entered university, I wanted to travel the world and experience the culture of every single country. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the funds to do so. So I searched for a way to get that same experience in the comfort of my home, and you wouldn’t imagine how elated I was to find a site that allowed me to achieve that wish.</p>

<p>Also at that time, I became more involved in the art of handmade and I used this opportunity to exchange handmade goods as well as craft supplies. This expanded not just my creative tools, but my imagination as well. It wasn’t long before I became ‘addicted’ to swapping with all the happy mail filling my letterbox.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “Today, although I have begun fulfilling my dream of travelling the world, I continue to do cultural exchanges because I love to see the world through someone else’s eyes. Also, there are so many places but so little time, so this has allowed me to explore more within a shorter span of time. Swapping has also expanded my crafting sphere and I love the thrill of giving and receiving something special. Furthermore, it has helped me expand my social circle beyond my country as I started penpalling with those I ‘met’ through the site. I couldn’t be more thankful for this site!”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “Cultural, handmade, and themed swaps.”</p>

<p><strong>One of mag’s most excellent sent swaps:</strong> “This was rather difficult for me to choose, so here’s my most recent cultural swap from Singapore to Portugal.” <em>(Seen below.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite swaps are letter swaps with beautiful stationery, hand cancelled stamps, and something real to say.”</p>

<p><strong>One of ColoradoKate’s most excellent sent swaps:</strong> “It was a Kawaii sticker flakes, matchbox, and surprise swap. I sent a little box of Apollo candy and some acrylic nails I decorated myself. I don’t only do Kawaii though, so I’ve also included a Small Denominations Stamps on an Envelope swap I did. I was sending to Canada, so I sent the full complement of USPS American Design stamps. Those rubber stamps I used were hand carved by another Swap-bot member!” <em>(Both swaps seen below)</em></p>

<p><strong>Say hello to our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:chelle523">chelle523</a>!</strong> Chelle523 is an <strong>Original Member</strong>, which means she has been on Swap-bot since before June, 2007. She has completed more than 360 swaps and received more than 650 “5” ratings! Amazing!</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> USA – Midwest Region</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/michelle-closeup.jpg" alt="michelle closeup" width="245" height="218" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11230" /><strong>How chelle523 found Swap-bot:</strong> “I found Swap-bot in 2006 (if I remember correctly). At the time I was on a Yahoo swapping group that traded ATCs, and had gotten discouraged at the lack of diversity in swaps and wanted to expand. A friend told me about Swap-bot and I’ve been hooked ever since!”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I love Swap-bot – it combines the best in artistic and creative expression, friendship and generosity, fun and it allows me to “meet” people from all corners of the globe! I love meeting people that share my interests and talents and I love meeting people whose lives and skills are completely different than my own! That little burst of excitement I get when I see an envelope or package in the mailbox is enough to make me a Swap-botter for life! I mean, when 90% of what we get in the mail is bills or junk, how can getting a beautiful envelope from across the world not put a smile on your face!?!”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite types of swaps are journals, pen pal swaps and whimsy jars, but honestly, I like just about every kind of swap we have.” <em>Obviously, chelle523 is also interested in ATCs. Check out three of her wonderful ATC creations below…</em></p>

<p>————</p>

<p><strong>Say hello to our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:heidec">HeideC</a>!</strong> HeideC is an <strong>Original Member</strong>, which means she has been on Swap-bot since before June, 2007. Awesome!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/heidec.jpg" alt="heidec" width="300" height="378" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11220" /><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> USA – Cincinnati, Ohio &amp; Ohio Valley Region</p>

<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/heidec/">HeideC’s Flickr photos!</a></strong> (She has lots of swap and craft photos!)</p>

<p><strong>How HeideC found Swap-bot:</strong> “I think I originally found Swap-bot when I was trying to get some information about ATCs. When I googled ATC some flickr pictures came up and they referred to Swap-bot. The rest, as they say, is history!”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I love Swap-bot for its diversity and its acceptance of inexperience! When I look back on some of the ATCs, I have made I cringe a little…the first ones were very rough! I still remember the first ATC I made that I felt so very proud of <em>(seen below)</em>. It’s still on my flickr account as my favorite ATC. And having the advice of more experienced artists really helps. Swap-bot gave me the courage to make my first quilt…something I never thought I could do. Now I get people at work asking me to make quilts for them; its quite a boost to my self-esteem!”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/heidec/3679438837/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/heidecatc.jpg" alt="heidecatc" width="600" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11221" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite type of swap at the moment is ATCs, but I am also having fun in the Thriftstore Find group, its really a challenge to find something your partner will like that also fits the swap theme. As an example, the February theme was “red”… I found a tin that had previously held red scottie dog shaped licorice, filled it with other red goodies, taped it shut and mailed it naked… the Post Office ladies loved that one!”</p>

<p><strong>Interesting facts about HeideC:</strong> “I love yard sales and go to the flea market every Wednesday morning. I love to read and read 3-4 books a week. My favorite flowers are lilacs, lilly of the valley and lavender.”</p>

<p><strong>Say hello to our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:doulakk">doulakk</a>!</strong> A Swap-bot member since 2012, doulakk loves snail mail and crafting, and has completed over 350 swaps and has hosted more than 100! Wow.</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> USA, East Coast Region</p>

<p><strong>How doulakk found Swap-bot:</strong> “I found SB by searching on Google after searching for an online swapping site with reputable members.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I enjoy SB because it allows me to make art and share my collection of ephemera. I have also tried painting, stamping and gelli plates because of SB, so it helps me to open my mind to other aspects of my new found love for art, in general.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite type of swap would have to be sending and receiving Envies full of Ephemera for journaling. I equally love sending ATC’s.

<p>————</p>

<p><strong>Say hello to our first Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mariadastrouxas">mariadastrouxas</a>!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Portugal</p>

<p><strong>Her packaging design Pinterest portfolio:</strong> <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/anaisabelmorais/">www.anaisabelmorais.com</a></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/maria-das-trouxas.jpg" alt="maria-das-trouxas" width="300" height="326" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11171" /><strong>How mariadastrouxas found Swap-bot:</strong> “Once I searched on google for international swaps and I found the website <a href="http://www.lettersets.com">www.lettersets.com</a>. On that website I contacted a portuguese swapper and she recommended the Swap-bot forum. When I checked it out, I never let it go.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “It’s so much fun. It’s such as a fantastic feeling when you receive a package from someone you don’t know physically but they spent their time to send you items you may like. It’s wonderful. I learned so many things about cultures from around the world, without traveling. It’s beautiful and true!”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “I prefer private Type 3 swaps (food, toiletries and stationary), usually large packages decorated with different postage stamps and calligraphies (mail art packages). For private swaps I can choose partners with a profile like mine so it’s more personal than public ones.”</p>

<p><em>Note from Rachel: mariadastrouxas is an amazing mail artist! Her packages are incredibly detailed and colorful, and she packages everything in ingenious ways! I have been very lucky to receive two of her beautiful packages in the past, including the one seen below.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mariadastrouxaspackage.jpg"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mariadastrouxaspackage.jpg" alt="mariadastrouxaspackage" width="600" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11176" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Interesting facts about mariadastrouxas:</strong> “Before I found swap-bot, when I was a child, I remember a School Program, an exchange connecting my (Portuguese) school and an international school. Some children swapped a shoe box with cute things and supplies we didn’t have in Portugal. I wasn’t selected to be a part of that experience, but I never forgot it because I would have loved to be in that program.”</p>

<p>“In middle school, my english school teacher told me about a Penpalling Program. The whole class wrote letters to English children, but i never received a reply. I was a kid and felt so sad about not receiving any response. Much later I registered on Flickr (maybe 2003), made a profile, and did some swaps with Brazilian crafters. The packages from Brazil took a long time to arrive, one year at least!”</p>

<p>“When I went to university I forget the feeling of receiving snail mail because the lessons took so much time and effort, and I had to move from my home to study, so it was difficult to manage the mail in other addresses. After I started working I finally had more money and I registered on a <a href="http://tralhasgratis.forumeiros.com">Portuguese forum</a> for free mail stuff and I received so much cool snail mail, like coupons and cinema tickets, but it was only suitable for Portuguese people and not so creative.”</p>

<p>“When i meet swap-bot, my life changed! There are so much creative persons and different cultures. I hope to continue swapping for my entire life!”</p>

<p>————</p>

<p><em>I hope you liked our first Ambassador interview and introduction. If you are interested in swapping high quality mail art packages of goodies, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mariadastrouxas">mariadastrouxas</a> would make an excellent partner! Contact her via the Swap-bot message system if you are interested.</em></p>

<p>This is the first edition of a new Swap-bot blog series: <strong>Member Spotlights</strong> . Our plan is to interview and highlight a new Swap-bot member every other week. This week, we would like to introduce you to <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sewcrazy"><strong>sewcrazy</strong></a>. Sewcrazy’s real name is Betty and she is one of the most prolific swappers on the ‘bot. At this time, she is the member with the most hearts: 842!! She has sent nearly 600 swaps and has received over 1000 ratings! Wow! Betty loves swapping ATCs, and you can see her holding one of her many ATC binders in the photo above. (As for the car behind Betty, her husband of 43 years, Bill, is a huge fan of NASCAR.)</p>

<p>I asked Betty a few questions about herself and her love of swapping…</p>

<p><strong>How did you first get involved with Swap-bot?</strong></p>

<p>I was trading ATCs on another site and Jennifer, the coordinator of ‘Somethings Fishy,’ told me about this site.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite item to swap?</strong></p>

<p>I have enjoyed swapping ATCs the most for two reasons: one, because I just love creating these little treasures of art, and two, because if and when I get flaked on (and yes, there has been a few) I am not really loosing much. Not that I consider my ATCs ‘not much’. I just feel there has to be a reason why my partners’ ATCs didn’t get to their destination. It hasn’t stopped me from continuing to swap.</p>

<p><strong>Do you usually do international or more local swaps?</strong></p>

<p>I do international on the ATCs only, because postage-wise it isn’t too expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Describe the best (or one of the best) swap packages you have ever received?</strong></p>

<p>I have received so many good swaps that I couldn’t really name one. But, I think my favorite was the comment and heart that I received from a partner to whom I sent, and she sent me a thank you surprise. She was ecstatic about a set of ATCs. It made me feel very good.</p>

<p><strong>What do you like most about swapping?</strong></p>

<p>The friendship and the chance to show off what I do, good or bad, people are very receptive of everything.</p>

<p><strong>How much time per week do you spend working on swaps?</strong></p>

<p>I couldn’t really say how much time I spend per week. Sometimes I can sit down and whip out a bunch of ATCs and other times I struggle to come up with the theme. I usually have them done ahead of time and waiting for my partners’ names. I sign up for a swap only if I can envision the ATC and have the materials to create it, without having to run to town to get something to complete it.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a type of swap have you always wanted to try, but haven’t yet?</strong></p>

<p>I have probably tried most swaps. Some only once, others more to try and get a feel for them. But, I always end up sticking to ATCs, I like them the most.</p>

<p><strong>What are your other hobbies, besides swapping?</strong></p>

<p>I am a seamstress, love to make quilts and incorporate that talent into some of my ATCs. I teach a quilt class in Othello, Washington, where I used to live. I also have just recently taken up greeting card making. And, there again, I use some of the ideas from the cards that I make, scaled down to ATC size. I love to check out yard sales and flea markets to find treasures for my ATCs.</p>

<p><strong>What does your family and friends think of your swapping habit?</strong></p>

<p>My family enjoys seeing what I have done, I think!!! I got my daughter hooked on making ATCs. We have a lot of fun trading through swaps and sharing ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any advice for first-time swappers or new Swap-bot members?</strong></p>

<p>Enjoy what you do, don’t stress yourself out on a swap. Your work is your work, period. Don’t let anyone else’s work intimidate you. But, mostly, just enjoy what you create.</p>

<p><strong>Who would you like to see interviewed next for a member spotlight?</strong></p>

<p>That would be Swap-bot member, dolly, and of course, my daughter, VWwoman07. She is very creative and is a lot like me. I have traded with dolly a lot and she comes up with some pretty unique ATCs, I always love to receive cards from her.</p>

<p>——————–</p>

<p>Thank you, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sewcrazy">sewcrazy</a> , for your great responses and swapping advice!</p>
