		<p>The USPS has released their <a href="https://www.usps.com/holiday/welcome.htm">Holiday Shipping Info</a>. Here are some of the important recommended <strong>First Class Mail</strong> shipping dates if you want to get items to your recipient by December 25:</p>

<p>**Domestic Mail – Ship by December 20th</p>

<p>International Mail, Africa &amp; South America – Ship by December 2nd</p>

<p>International Mail, everywhere else – Ship by December 9th</p>

<p>**</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/holiday/default.jsf">Canada Post suggested holiday mailing dates.</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.royalmail.com/greetings">Royal Mail recommended last posting dates for holiday packages.</a></li>
</ul>
<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://buyanabolicsteroidss.com/">steroids.com</a>
</div>

<p>The postal services work hard over the holidays to deliver a huge quantity of gifts and greeting cards, but keep in mind that items may be delayed. If possible, work in a few extra mail transit days into your swap planning. If you are creating a new swap, keep in mind that most post offices will be closed on December 25 and January 1st, so plan your mail deadlines accordingly.</p>

<p><strong><em>There is still time to get in some fun holiday swapping, but don’t wait too long!!</em></strong></p>

		<p>Swapping postcards and quick crafts is plenty of fun, but sometimes swappers crave a more in-depth, time-intensive craft swap experience. After feeling the surge in creativity that you get from small swaps, it is completely understandable that many swappers want to take the step up to larger projects….</p>

<p>BUT, there are a few things to consider before hosting or signing up for a big project swap. Big, lengthy swaps have the potential to be risky.</p>

<p><strong>Some examples of time-intensive swaps:</strong> Journal swaps, 100 ATCs or 100 inchies (or any large number), knitting or crochet projects, large art project swaps, like paintings or sculpture, and any type of Round Robin style swap where each participants contributes to a project and then mails it on.</p>

<p><strong>Here are my tips for creating or choosing a time-intensive swap:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>As always, carefully <strong>check over the swap coordinator’s profile</strong> and rating history before joining a big swap (or any swap). If you are the host, carefully check over your participants’ profiles. Have they done Type 3 swaps before? Have they done time-intensive craft swaps before? Have they been on Swap-bot long enough to indicate that they are committed to the system and to staying active at least long enough to complete your swap?</li>
  <li>Swap which have a very long stretch of time between the sign up deadline and the mail deadline (more than a month) are risky. The more time between when partners are assigned and when the swap must be mailed usually correlates with the number of swappers who go missing, leave Swap-bot, or become suspended due to unsent swaps. <strong>I suggest NOT joining swaps with more than a month between the sign up and mail deadlines.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Time-intensive public swaps are the most risky.</strong> Participants don’t necessarily intend to become non-senders, but inexperienced swappers can often get overly excited about the idea of a big swap, but not truly realize the time ad effort it will take to complete it. Private or group swaps are a good way to participate in safer swaps, but they still are not 100% guaranteed to run smoothly.</li>
  <li>If you want to coordinate a big, time-intensive swap, make sure to <strong>set very clear and strict requirements</strong> and stick to them when weeding out participants. Don’t be afraid to remove swappers who seem questionable.</li>
  <li>Round Robin style swaps have been attempted many times, but they never seem to work out as planned. In order for a Round Robin swap to be successful, every single person must be committed to the swap. If one person drops out, the entire process is stalled. They are an awesome swap idea, but <strong>I do NOT suggest hosting Round Robin swaps except within very trusted groups of swap friends.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Always keep in mind that swapping is inherently risky</strong>, even with the feedback and safety measures used on Swap-bot. Things can happen which prevent users from sending. There is always a chance that you may not receive a swap. Do not join swaps that are too expensive or require more of a commitment than what you find fun and enjoyable. Swap items that you love making, just for creativity’s sake.</li>
  <li>Not receiving a swap is a major bummer, especially when it is a big, time-intensive swap. <strong>It is extremely important to rate your non-sending partners with a 1</strong> so that future swap hosts will know not to allow them in their swaps.</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you think? Do you join time-intensive, big project swaps? Leave you tips for successful swapping in the comments…</p>

<p>Do you keep a journal or diary? How about a visual diary or altered journal? Art journaling is an art form that incorporates writing, drawing, painting, collage, and scrapbooking within a bound book of some type. It is a way of expressing yourself freely and experimenting with different techniques. You can find some amazing examples of art journaling on <a href="http://pinterest.com/search/?q=art+journal">Pinterest</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%22art%20journal%22">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>User <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:spinjenny">spinjenny</a> (whose journal pages are seen above) describes visual journaling like this:</p>

<p><em>Looking at other people’s pages shows what a wide range of journals people keep. For some people, it is a diary, a notebook, a record of their experiments, a resource for later reference, or somewhere to let out their deepest feelings. Some are really sketchbooks with a few more words than usual. Some are mainly words with some decoration – painted backgrounds, doodles, cartoons or more realistic sketches. Some are multi-layered mixed media art. Anything goes! There are no rights or wrongs in journalling, just what works best for you. I’m still in the experimenting stage – looking at a lot of other people’s work, and trying out styles and materials.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/77118/1">topic of art journaling</a> was recently brought up in the Swap-bot forums by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mrsdutton">mrsdutton</a> and many helpful users responded with some great tips and links.

It is wonderful to use for decorating packages or crafts. How would you like to make your own deco tape using your home computer and your own designs? Swap-bot user, (with a little help from users and ) has shared this DecoTape tutorial with us… Enjoy!</em></p>

<p>—————————————-</p>

<p><strong>How To Make DecoTape</strong></p>

<div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-2177px;">
</div>

<p><em>by:</em></p>

<p>DecoTape is decorative tape usually with very kawaii (cute) prints on it. It can be used to decorate things like stationery, art journals, and collages. DecoTape also makes a cute small gift. Although it is widely available in Japan, it is not in many other places. That’s why I’ve decided to make a tutorial on how to make DecoTape for all those kawaii fans out there.</p>

<p><strong>Supplies:</strong></p>

<p>You are going to need some supplies to make this project. These are very basic and cheap items you can find at home.</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular paper (the kind that fits in the printer)</li>
  <li>scotch photosafe magic tape</li>
  <li>a computer or laptop</li>
  <li>a printer</li>
  <li>parchment or wax paper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The ink on the tape on the paper will be wet!</li>
  <li>Use white or light-colored backgrounds when picking a pattern for your tape!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How-to:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Cover a sheet of regular printer paper with the Scotch tape. Make sure there are no gaps.</li>
  <li>Put the paper covered with tape in the printer so when it prints, the ink will be printed on the smooth side where the tape is.</li>
  <li>Search Google images or another search engine and find a pattern for your tape or create your own pattern with your designs!</li>
  <li>Open Microsoft Paint or another editing program and put the pattern in that program. You can get as creative as you want!</li>
  <li>Print it. Take caution with taking it out of the printer because it will be wet!</li>
  <li>Use a strip of tape and put it over the wet ink, leaving extra tape so you can pull it off. Make sure the sticky side of the tape is on the ink.</li>
  <li>Pull off the tape and stick it on the parchment or wax paper. Later you can cut it out or do whatever else you want to do with it.</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 6-7 as many times as you want or until the ink dries out.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are also many alternatives! For example, you could use a plastic sheet like a transparency instead of a sheet covered in tape! You can also use some packaging tape for a larger image!</p>

<p><strong>Uses:</strong></p>

<p>There are many uses for Deco Tape! They make great goodies, can liven up stationery, and are a nice touch to art journals. You can use them as labels, too! You can create them, collect them, and trade them! Maybe one day, after reading this, someone might even do a hand-made DecoTape swap on !</p>

<p><strong>Comments!</strong></p>

<p>Please leave a comment! I’d love it if you had any comments, questions, or fixes!</p>

		<p>With December right around the corner, the USPS is gearing up for another busy holiday mailing season. The USPS has released its holiday shipping dates. Even if you are not concerned about getting your package to someone by December 25th, keep in mind that mailing and shipping times can be much longer during the holidays. If you do want a package to arrive by Christmas (especially internationally) mail it as early as possible!!</p>

<p><strong>USPS Holiday Mail Deadlines:</strong></p>

<p><strong>First Class Mail:</strong> Domestic – Dec-21, International – Dec 4</p>

<p><strong>Priority Mail:</strong> Domestic – Dec-21, International – Dec 4</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.wishpot.com/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/wishpot.gif" alt="wishpot" title="wishpot" width="160" height="65" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1840" /></a>We have a fun new profile feature to tell you about! We have partnered with <a href="http://www.wishpot.com/">Wishpot.com</a> – <em>a free social shopping service that makes it easy to save and share interesting things you find in stores and online</em> – to provide an animated, graphical wish list widget for your Swap-bot profile page. The widget is a fun (and totally optional) way to add a little spice to your profile page while letting your partners know a little more about you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wishpot.com/">Wishpot</a> is a free website that allows you to easily create wish lists, registries, or collections of cool things you find online. You can learn more about using Wishpot <a href="http://www.wishpot.com/help/howitworks-add.aspx">here</a>. Once you have created a Wishpot account, you can add a graphical wish list to your Swap-bot profile page.</p>

<p>To add the Wishpot widget to your profile, click on the “Edit Profile” option either on your profile page or in the drop down under the Profile link at the top of all Swap-bot pages. On the Profile Edit page you will now find a “Add-ons” link. Click there to find the Wishpot widget option. Below is a screen shot of what you will see on the Add-ons screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/wishpotscreenshot2.jpg" alt="wishpotscreenshot2" title="wishpotscreenshot2" width="470" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1861" /></p>

<p>You must authorize Swap-bot to access your Wishpot account by logging into Wishpot.com via the ” authorize Swap-bot to add a Wishpot” link. You will then be re-directed back to Swap-bot to select which of your wish lists you would like to share on your Swap-bot profile page. You could share you general wish list just for fun, or you could create a special swap-specific wish list just for use on Swap-bot. Wishpot allows you to create multiple different lists and make them private or public as you choose. However, the list and items you display on Swap-bot must be marked as public in order for your widget to work.</p>

<p>Here is what my Wishpot wish list widget looks like:</p>

<p>&lt;img style=”visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;” border=0 width=0 height=0 src=”http://counters.gigya.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEyNDY4ODkxNTAwMzgmcHQ9MTI*Njg4OTE3NzAyOSZwPTE5MDI1MSZkPSZnPTEmdD*mbz*1NWU3YTgzZmI3ODc*ZDBkOTk3ZTk5MTIwODYyMjI2YiZvZj*w.gif” /&gt;</p>

  <div style="text-align:right; margin-top:15px; padding-right: 10px;">
    <a href="http://www.wishpot.com/list.aspx?uid=22547&#038;list=80078&#038;rc=widget&#038;pkey=22547" target="_blank" style="color:0x666666; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-decoration:none" title="View my Wish List"><b>View my wish list on Wishpot &amp;raquo</b></a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>One activated, your Wishpot widget will be automatically placed at the very bottom of the text section of your profile page, just above your ratings. Your widget will update automatically any time you add a new item to your Wishpot list. (Wishpot makes it super-easy to add items to your lists with their browser bar button.) You can remove your widget at any time by going back to the Add-ons page in the Profile Edit screen and clicking on the “Deauthorize Wishpot and remove widget from profile” link. Because this is a brand new feature, there may still be a few kinks to work out. Let me know if you have any trouble or questions. In the future we hope to add more widget options that integrate your favorite online services with your Swap-bot account.</p>

<p>I am currently in the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/34799">Matchbox Backpack on a Dotee</a> swap and decided I wanted to try something a little different for the matchbox – something that would work well as a tiny backpack. I referred back to a beautiful matchbox sent to me by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ScullyB">ScullyB</a> for the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3588">Punch It! matchbox swap</a> back in 2007. The matchbox she sent had a seemingly intricate cover that worked something like an envelope for the little matchbox drawer inside. You can see photos of that matchbox <em>in action</em> above.</p>

<p>I decided to make something similar for my backpack matchbox and thought I would share a downloadable PDF template with you. (I don’t quite have my dotee and backpack complete, but I promise to post photos when I do!)</p>

<p>The inner drawer of this matchbox is exactly the same as my original <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/03/03/tuesday-tip-rachels-matchbox-template/">Matchbox Template</a>, but the outer wrap differs significantly. I constructed my outer envelope wrap a little differently than ScullyB, but it gives the same effect. The final matchbox constructed with this template will be about the same size as a standard store-bought 32-count matchbox – approximately 1.5 x 2 x .5 inches.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.swap-bot.com/files/enviematchboxtemplate.pdf"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/matchboxtemplate3.gif" alt="matchboxtemplate3" title="matchboxtemplate3" width="470" height="330" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://static.swap-bot.com/files/enviematchboxtemplate.pdf"><strong>Download the Envelope-style Matchbox Template PDF here.</strong></a></p>

<p>Here are the basic instructions that are printed on the template:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Print out template on cardstock at 100%. Do not “fit to paper size” or your matchbox will not be the correct size.</li>
  <li>Cut along all black lines; score and fold along all grey lines.</li>
  <li>Apply glue to the light grey areas of the inside drawer.</li>
  <li>Fold the sides of the inside drawer in on themselves (they will be end up being double thick) while tucking the tabs into the folds of the shorter sides of the drawer.</li>
  <li>Fold the outside wrap around the inside drawer while folding in its bottom and tucking in the tabs. (I suggest test folding the outer wrap around the inner drawer at first, then removing the inside drawer and doing the final fold with glue. This fold is a little tricky as you must tuck in the tabs and the final side.) Glue it in place.</li>
  <li>The flap on the right side of the outside wrap template is the matchbox’s envelope closure. Fold it over the top of the box and secure it with a seal or ribbon.</li>
  <li>Decorate your matchbox!</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Writing the instructions is the most difficult part of making these templates. I know they are confusing, but try printing the template on regular paper and practicing a few times before tackling the real deal in card stock. Let me know if you have any questions.</em></p>

		<p><strong>MARKDOWN TUTORIAL</strong> by Deana Barker (<a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:muincat">muincat</a>)</p>

<p>These days, it seems just about every Swap-Bot Forum I go into, someone has a question about how to change their profile, whether it be to add a badge, picture, link or whatever. Usually, the person doesn’t know a thing about Markdown language and is asking for help. I never ran across Markdown until I became a member of Swap Bot and it frustrated me at first, too. I followed the link provided by Swap-Bot to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">Daring Fireball: Markdown Basics</a>, but still found it difficult to work out what to do without specific examples pertinent to Swap-Bot, so that’s what I’m going to try to do for you all here in this post. With any luck, we’ll have you off into the land of customizing bliss in no time!</p>

<p><strong>PICTURES &amp; BADGES:</strong></p>

<p>This is the one I see the most questions on. “How can I add this badge/picture to my profile?”</p>

<p>Well, badges and pictures are really the same thing. First, you need to know the location of the image you want to use. It has to already be uploaded online somewhere since Swap-Bot does not have the capability of uploading graphics for profiles.</p>

<p>Let’s say I want to post the “I Pledge To Rate” badge created by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pgk">pgk</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/purplebadge.jpg" alt="I pledge to rate" title="pledge badge" width="103" height="107" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-810" /></p>

<p>This badge is located on the Swap-bot server at: http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg – In the case of most badges, however, the image location information will be provided for you by whomever created the badge. The graphics may be located on Photobucket, or Flickr, or on someone’s personal website. The location will always need to be an internet URL address – not a link to your personal computer.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll go into “Edit Profile” and decide where you want this badge to show up on your profile. When you find the spot, click on it, so that your cursor is in that spot, ready to type.</p>

<p>What you type to make the image appear on your profile page (the reason you’re all reading this!):</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>

<p>If you want to get fancy and add a description for folks who might not be able to load graphics for whatever reason, you would type something like this:</p>

<p><strong>![alt text](http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg)</strong></p>

<p>Lets say you want “alt text” to read “I pledge to rate.” It would look like this:</p>

<p><strong>![I Pledge to Rate](http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg)</strong></p>

<p>———-</p>

<p>You add other types of photos and pictures exactly the same way! How cool is that?! Let’s pretend you’ve got this really cute animated clip art you want on your profile, like this little kitty:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dancincat.gif" alt="dancincat" title="dancincat" width="95" height="100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-812" /></p>

<p>You would need to have him available somewhere online, like Flikr, Photobucket or your own personal website. I uploaded this little guy to my web server so I could show you how to do it. He is located at http://www.muincat.com/images/DancinCat.gif, so I would would find the place in my profile where I wanted to put him and type:</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.muincat.com/images/DancinCat.gif" alt="" /></strong></p>

<p>OR</p>

<p><strong>![Dancing Kitty](http://www.muincat.com/images/DancinCat.gif)</strong></p>

<p>———-</p>

<p><strong>MAKING HYPERLINKS:</strong></p>

<p>Great news! Hyperlinks are made the same way! The only difference is that you’re linking to a website instead of a picture file. Going back to the “I Pledge to Rate” example, you could put a link under the page that goes to the webpage that explains exactly what it is that you pledged like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/7681">What I Pledged</a></p>

<p>To make a link you type the words you would like hyperlinked in brackets, followed by the URL in parenthesis:</p>

<p><strong>[What I Pledged](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/7681)</strong></p>

<p>The whole thing with the graphic and link would look like this:</p>

<p>**![I Pledge to Rate](http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>[What I Pledged](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/7681) &lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>If you want to only post the graphic and make it a link, your code would look like this:</p>

<p><strong>[<img src="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/7681" alt="I Pledge to Rate](http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg)" /></strong></p>

<p>Another example would be if you wanted to make a link to your Amazon Wish List. Find the place in your profile that you’d like to add the link. You’d like it to say <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1QLOE6JUSKNJ2">This is my Amazon Wishlist</a> . Type:</p>

<p><strong>[This is my Amazon Wish List](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1QLOE6JUSKNJ2)</strong></p>

<p>Just make sure you type YOUR wish list URL and not the one above, since its mine. But then again, if you’d like the whole world to send me gifts from Amazon, I’m fine with that! 😉</p>

<p>———</p>

<p><strong>OTHER FORMATTING:</strong></p>

<p>OK, pictures and links are the two biggest things that everyone wants to do. There are, however, a few other things that can make things look nice.</p>

<p>If you’d like to make a</p>

<h2 id="big-headline">Big Headline</h2>

<p>(Heading 1), just type equal signs under it like so:</p>

<p>Big Headline</p>

<p>==========</p>

<p>If you’d like a</p>

<h1 id="smaller-headline">Smaller Headline</h1>

<p>(Heading 2), like for a subcategory, just type dashes on the line under it like so:</p>

<p>Smaller Headline</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>The next level down is considered</p>

<h3 id="heading-3">Heading 3</h3>

<p>and would be typed with 3 pound signs before it like this:</p>

<p>###Heading 3</p>

<p>Bulleted lists are probably the easiest thing of all to make. All you have to do is put an asterisk before each item in the list and it will make it for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Item 1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Item 2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Item 3</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Gives you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want a numbered list, just do the same as above, but use a number with a period after it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Item</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another Item</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Gives You:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Item</li>
  <li>Another Item</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’d like to make something show up in <em>italics</em> on your profile, all you have to do is add an asterisk on either side of the word or phrase you’d like emphasized. If you want something written in <strong>bold</strong>, use TWO asterisks on both sides of the word or phrase.</p>

<p>———-</p>

<p>Last, but not least, the “Preview” button is your friend! If you’re not sure that you typed something correctly, just hit the preview button and you’ll be able to check your work. Also, you can go to the code generator at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus">Daring Fireball</a> to do a trial run. The first box is where you type what you want to try. Below the box, you’ll find two drop down menus. Leave the first one (“Filter”) set to “Markdown” and the “Results” drop down should be set to “Preview.” Click “Convert” and the next box shows you what it will really look like to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>———-</p>

<p><em>Thank you to Deana for such a detailed and helpful tutorial! We (Travis &amp; Rachel) chose to allow Markdown (as opposed to HTML) on Swap-bot for formatting because it helps keep the site safe from HTML code which could cause problems. Markdown is also meant to be a simpler language that is easier to learn. You can use any of the formatting options discussed above on your profile page, within swap descriptions, and within the Swap-bot Forums. There is more helpful information about using Markdown on the <a href="http://swap-bot.pbworks.com/formatting+and+linking+on+swap-bot">Swap-bot Wiki</a>. Have fun!</em></p>

		<p>Creating a descriptive profile page is an important part of swapping on Swap-bot, but what does that entail? And, how do you make your profile fabulous?</p>

<p>The Swap-bot “Edit Profile” page is extremely simple in design, but it allows you endless possibilities for customization. The “Personal” link at the top of the “Edit Profile” page is where you go to add information to your profile page.</p>

<p>&lt;img style=”border:1px solid black;” src=”http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/editprofile-300x155.jpg” alt=”Click on Edit Profile “ title=”Click on Edit Profile “ width=”300” height=”155” class=”size-medium wp-image-791” “ srcset=”http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/editprofile-300x155.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/editprofile.jpg 377w” sizes=”(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px” /&gt;</p>

<p>Once you are there, follow these tips:</p>

<p><strong>First, Add URLs</strong></p>

<p>This is where you can prominently place links to other places on the internet that you inhabit, such as your blog(s), your MySpace Profile, your Flickr Photos, and if you’re an indie artist who sells your work, links to your Etsy store, your Artfire studio, etc. If you have wishlists on other sites, you can also add those links. Swap-bot provides a dropdown list with a few of these titles for the links, including My Amazon Wishlist, but you must provide the correct link address. For the wishlists, make sure you are not logged in on that site when you copy the link address or it won’t work for other people. If what you want to link to isn’t on the drop down list, just click on “other” and Swap-bot lets you name the link what you want, such as My Etsy Faves.</p>

<p><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/personal-300x195.jpg" alt="" title="Add URLs" width="300" height="195" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-792" /></p>

<p><strong>Second, Add info about yourself</strong></p>

<p>The “Profile Edit” page starts out only showing one profile section, but you can add additional sections to your profile by clicking the “Add Another” link. You can choose from the pre-set section titles, or create your own by selecting “Other” and typing in a title.</p>

<p><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/aboutme-300x256.jpg" alt="" title="Add info about yourself" width="300" height="256" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-793" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/aboutme-300x256.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/aboutme.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

<p>Following are some suggestions for what to include in each section:</p>

<ul>
  <li>About me</li>
</ul>

<p>This is where you give people a general idea of who you are. You can include things like your job, a bit about your family, your hobbies and so on. You could include information about whether you would like to do one-on-one swaps with others, or if you are interested in specialized swaps. Add as much info as you would like, but remember that Swap-bot profiles are public, so do not include anything that you do not want to be public knowledge.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Favourite crafts</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do enjoy crafting, describe your projects here. Do you crochet, sew, are you interested in paper crafts, ATCs? If you are mainly interested in postcard or letter swaps, you can skip this section. You do not have to include all (or any) of the pre-set sections in your profile – they are simply suggestions to get you started.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Favorite books/videos/music</li>
</ul>

<p>These are pretty self-explanatory sections. If you do love movies, books, tv or music, you can give them each their own area on your profile page. The type of info included in these sections may not affect the swap packages that your partners send, but it will help them get to know you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Other sections</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no limit to what other sections you can add to your profile. Some users have added sections specifically about their family members, or about special collections they have. You can create an area for anything you would like to share about your self on your profile page.</p>

<p>A lot of swapbot users list their likes and dislikes under special sections. These two categories of info are very important for profile-specific swaps and swaps where your partner is likely to go looking for making that special thing for you. Your partner will get inspiration and maybe find information about what little extras you might like. The more information you include, the better are your chances of receiving a parcel you really like. You could list things like your favorite colors, craft materials, candy, and other items you would like to receive. It is equally important to list your dislikes. Include any allergies or intolerances you may have to things.</p>

<p>You can also create a section to discuss how you handle swapping in general. The section can include statements about rating, being rated, how and when you send swaps, and what you do if you dont receive a swap.</p>

<p>Have fun adding “other” information to your profile page! Make it a place where others can quickly get to know you.</p>

<p><strong>Adding Images and graphics</strong></p>

<p>You are not required to add images and graphic to your profile, but some members have a lot of fun customizing their page. If you want to decorate your profile, you must first upload your graphic somewhere online (like on flickr or photobucket) and then you can use Markdown code to link to the images for display on your profile page. There is more information about using Markdown on the Swap-bot wiki, <a href="http://swap-bot.pbworks.com/formatting+and+linking+on+swap-bot">here</a>. Also, stay tuned for a handy Markdown tutorial on an upcoming Tuesday Tip post!</p>

		<p>Creating and running a swap on Swap-bot is a lot of fun, but it is also a big responsibility. Here are some important tips on how to run a successful swap:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Give a Detailed Description</strong> – When creating a swap make sure that you have clearly and thoroughly explained your swap idea. Include a description of the item(s) being swapped, an explanation of the craft technique being utilized (with links to instructional websites if needed), and a clear statement of what is expected from participants. A dollar value or number of items expected to be sent for the swap may be needed. Also, make sure you include what kind of requirements participants are expected to have, such as a completed profile, minimum rating, number of swaps completed, etc. The more detailed your description, the more likely you are to attract committed, quality swappers to your swap.</li>
  <li><strong>Create a Swap Graphic</strong> – A custom graphic or image for your swap is not required, but it does give your swap an identity and it shows that you are dedicated swap host.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate with Participants</strong> – Be available for any questions members may have via private message and email. Check your swap page periodically to read comments left by participants and respond if needed. Clearly and kindly explaining your expectations will help your swap run smoothly.</li>
  <li><strong>Check Over Participants</strong> – This may be the most important tip! After the sign up deadline for your swap has closed, carefully check over your list of participants and remove any user who does not meet your rating or region requirements, or who does not appear to be a strong swapper. Swap-bot is an open website which accepts all different types of people from all over the world. We believe diversity of culture and opinion strengthens and enriches the community, but it also means that there may be people on Swap-bot with whom you are not comfortable swapping. As swap coordinator, it is your duty to protect your swap participants from questionable or dishonest users. Swap-bot’s automatic suspension system and Admin are the first line of defense against questionable swappers, but we rely on our coordinators to be a second line of defense against swap lifting and other undesirable behavior. If you come across a user who makes you uncomfortable, remove them from your swap before assigning partners and report them to Swap-bot Admin (questions [at] swap-bot.com).</li>
  <li><strong>Send Your Swap</strong> &lt;/b&gt; – This is a no-brainer, but it is especially disappointing when a swap coordinator does not send their swap!</li>
  <li><strong>Follow up with your participants</strong> – About 2-3 weeks after the send date, follow up with your participants to see if everybody has sent and received their swap. You can email your participants as a group, or just look over the details on the swap’s participant page. You may choose to angel your swap or arrange angels, if needed. Make sure to remind any swappers who did not receive a swap to rate their sending partner honestly with a 1 rating. Honest ratings help weed out the dishonest users more quickly. If you had any major problems with any of your participants, report them to Swap-bot Admin (questions [at] swap-bot.com).</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are some of my general tips for how to be a good swap coordinator, but what else makes a coordinator extra special? What tips do you have for first time coordinators?</p>

		<p>This is a quick tip that I think will cut down on swap flaking – or at least make it less likely for you to personally encounter it. When choosing swaps, <strong>only join those which you will have the most fun completing instead of ones that you would most like to receive.</strong> We all love to receive our snail mail swap packages, but swapping should be a creative process that is enjoyable on both the sending and receiving sides.</p>

<p>In the more than three years that we have been running Swap-bot, Travis and I have noticed a pattern in the swaps that the truly malicious flakers gravitate toward. The more expensive “go buy such and such for your partner” swaps are always targeted by the thieves. Not to say that putting together a fun package of goodies for your partner isn’t rewarding, but it is smart to be selective about which store-bought swaps you participate in. Private or group store-bought swaps are much safer. And never sign up for a swap you cannot afford! Inexpensive mail swaps, like postcards and letters, are a still lot of fun without being as financially risky.</p>

<p>Creative craft and art swaps can certainly still end up with flakers, but most of the fun in these swaps is in sharing your creation with others. The swappers who sign up for craft and art swaps are usually very interested in the creative process and love the challenge of creating something new, not just the promise of receiving a package. Swapping can help you explore your creativity while also connecting you with other artists, writers, crafters, and makers from around the world.</p>

<p>There are a few more tips on how to choose successful swaps in <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/11/18/tuesday-tip-choosing-swaps/">this previous Tuesday Tip post</a>. Please add your suggestions for how to choose swaps in the comments section.</p>

<p><strong>5/14/09 UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few more helpful tips for how to choose safer swaps from Swap-bot user, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:LINDA50">LINDA50</a> :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not sign up for swaps with hosts with less than 40 completed swaps.&lt;/a&gt;
    <ul>
      <li>Do not stay in swaps with questionable swappers. Either have the host ban them or drop the swap.</li>
      <li>If the swap title has the word bored in it, don’t join. Don’t know why this word attrats flakers but it does.</li>
      <li>Avoid public swaps for items that require a large time (or money) investment.</li>
      <li>Go for low value, medium effort public swaps.</li>
      <li>Do not wait two or three months to give a one. Ones can always be changed, but you cannot go back and warn people. The longer it takes to spot a flaker the more they walk away with.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&lt;/uL&gt;</p>

    <p>Thanks, Linda!!</p>

<p>I love doing matchbox swaps. Altering and decorating the tiny boxes and filling them full of little treasures is always fun. Many people decorate real (pre-made cardboard) matchboxes that they purchase or collect for their matchboxes swaps. However, I prefer to make my matchboxes from scratch using heavy card stock. I find the handmade boxes easier to decorate and customize.</p>

<p>At the Swap-bot event on Sunday I passed out the template I created and use for making my matchboxes from scratch. It is very simple, but I thought others may be interested in using it. Here you can download a PDF version of my template. (Make sure to download the full-size document using the link below. Do not use the above .gif.) Matchboxes constructed using my template will be just slightly larger than a standard 32-count matchbox (approximately 1.5 x 2 x .5 inches). You can also print and then trace the template onto light cardboard, such as cereal box cardboard, if you prefer.</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Print out template on cardstock at 100%. Do not “fit to paper size” or your matchbox will not be the correct size.</li>
  <li>Cut along all black lines; score and fold along all grey lines.</li>
  <li>Apply glue to the light grey areas of the inside drawer.</li>
  <li>Fold the sides of the inside drawer in on themselves (they will be end up being double thick) while tucking the tabs into the folds of the shorter sides of the drawer.</li>
  <li>Fold the outside wrap around the inside drawer and glue it in place.</li>
  <li>Decorate your matchbox!</li>
</ol>

<p>Your matchbox should end up looking something like this:</p>

		<h1><a class="post-link" href="/2009/02/24/tuesday-tip-top-5-recession-proof-craft-tips/">tuesday tip: Top 5 Recession-proof Craft Tips</a></h1>

		<p>The recession is hitting everyone hard these days and sometimes crafting and swapping is especially hard to fit into our budgets. But, wait a minute! There are some great ways that we can support our crafty habits even during a recession. Following are my top five tips for recession-proof crafting:</p>

<li value="5">
  <b>Recycle and use what you already have and.</b> How many stacks and containers of supplies do you have in your craft area right now? Tons, right? Now is the time to start using your stockpiles creatively. After all, crafting is all about expressing your creativity &#8212; not buying the latest stuff at the craft store. Also, lots of everyday objects, and even things we consider to be trash, can be very helpful when crafting. Cereal boxes make great starting surfaces for postcards, Artist Trading Cards, or altered matchboxes. Old cd jewel cases can be made into <a href="http://www.24x7digital.com/content/view/91/77/">super-cute and handy calendars</a>. Plastic grocery bags can be made into all sorts of things by <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/crafting/crocheted-plastic/index.html">crocheting</a> or <a href="http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2007/08/plastic_bag_crafts.html">melting</a> them. <a href="http://www.craftbits.com/viewProject.do?projectID=155">CDs</a>, clothes pins, <a href="http://whipup.net/2009/01/12/tutorial-baby-socks-from-woollen-sweater/">old sweaters</a> , film canisters, <a href="http://tipnut.com/things-to-do-with-old-jeans/">denim</a>, <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/la/look/20-household-uses-for-newspaper-once-youve-finished-the-crossword-050121">newspaper</a>, and really anything else you can think of can be re-purposed into fun craft projects.
</li>
<li value="4">
  <b>Be patient before buying new craft supplies. </b> This is a no-brainer, but having patience really can pay off. If you must buy new things from you favorite local craft stores or online retailers, simply wait for them to put things on sale or run a promotion. This may mean buying holiday-themed items after the holiday or waiting for a special coupon to come in the mail. (Don&#8217;t we all love those 40% off <a href="http://www.michaels.com/art/online/home">Michael&#8217;s</a> coupons?!) Make a commitment to only buy sale items when/if you shop at (pricey) specialty craft stores and you will save a bundle.
</li>
<li value="3">
  <b>Shop dollar and discount stores.</b> Dollar stores and discount stores are an affordable place to find crafting supplies. Some sell craft-related things, but often you can find everyday items at discount stores that make great craft materials. Purchase clothing at thrift stores to use for fabric projects, or buy cheap children&#8217;s book to use in scrapbooking or collage. <a href="http://dollarstorecrafts.com/">Dollar Store Crafts</a> has tons of great craft ideas using inexpensive materials.
</li>
<li value="2">
  <b>Craft for a cause.</b> The recession is affecting everyone, but the poor are being hit especially hard. Take some time to create something special for someone in need and you will be sure to feel better about your own situation. For ideas check out <a href="http://handmadehelpsout.blogspot.com/search/label/Auction">Handmade Help</a> (a site dedicated to helping those affected by the Australian bush fires) and <a href="http://homespunhelpers.blogspot.com/">Homespun Helpers</a> (a group creating handmade items for multiple charities).
</li>
<li value="1">
  <b>Swap, Swap, Swap!</b> &#8211; In addition to being fun and entertaining, swapping can help replenish your craft supply stash by trading things you do not need for new-to-you supplies from other swappers. You can also continue to have fun swapping and meeting people from all over the world without spending any money by doing electronic swaps &#8211; swaps via email.
</li>

<p>So, those are my top five tips for staying crafty during the recession. What are your tips?</p>

		<p>The long-term plan is to create a Swap-bot wiki to which everyone will be able to add helpful info. In the meantime, I am going to be collecting some helpful tips here on the blog. We have lots of new members signing up all of the time and sometimes it can be overwhelming to jump into the land of Swap-bot. Today I want to give some tips to consider when picking and choosing which swaps to join.</p>

<p>There are many things to consider before signing up for a swap. Two of the most obvious things to consider are your own interests and your time restraints. Once you have set your own guidelines for the type of swaps you would enjoy and have time to complete, there are many other criteria which can help you determine which swaps will be most successful. Each swap is created and owned by its individual swap coordinator… and some coordinators are more successful than others. Sometimes coordinators abandon swaps or do not check over swap participants (and weed out problem people) before assigning partners. To avoid those types of situations, be choosey about which swap you join.</p>

<p>These are my suggestions for determining which swaps will be most successful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good swaps have detailed swap descriptions. Don’t sign up for swaps with one-sentence descriptions. You want to see that the coordinator put some time and care into their swap. A custom swap graphic or a fun and detailed description are usually good signs that the coordinator is invested in hosting a successful swap.</li>
  <li>Check over the swap coordinator’s profile (by clicking on the coordinator’s username) and swap record. Don’t sign up for swaps hosted by coordinators with poor ratings. Also, make sure that the coordinator has a filled out profile and has participated in a good number of previous swaps. Experienced swappers make good swap coordinators.</li>
  <li>Once you have signed up for a swap, view the full list of swap participants. If there are many swappers with bad ratings, or if there is a particular swapper you don’t get along with in the swap, drop from the swap. Remember to go back and check the list of participants right before the sign up deadline to make sure you still feel comfortable swapping with the other participants.</li>
  <li>If you have questions about a swap, feel free to contact the swap coordinator. If they are committed to hosting a successful swap they will not mind answering your questions.</li>
  <li>Be especially picky when joining high dollar value swaps. Swaps that ask users to go out and buy expensive items for their partners can be suspicious. Make sure to only join swaps which you consider completely affordable. Sometimes (sadly) swappers flake on swaps and you do not want to send a very expensive swap and then not receive anything in return.</li>
  <li>Only sign up for swaps which you will absolutely love creating and sending. Swapping is about sharing and meeting new people – not making monetary-based deals or trades. There are new swaps being created all of the time, so you don’t need to sign up for anything that seems questionable.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, those are my suggestions. What else do you think swappers should consider before joining swaps? Please add your suggestions in the comments. Thanks!</p>
