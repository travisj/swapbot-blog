		<p>Over the weekend we were hard at work making a few improvements to Swap-bot’s hosting infrastructure. With the improvements, we made a few small, but important changes.</p>

<p><strong>First,</strong> we decided to move to UTC (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a>, also know as Greenwich Mean Time) as the official time zone of Swap-bot. Prior to this change, we used EST and EDT, but since we are a community with members all over the world, we needed to use a time zone that all of us could more easily understand. UTC does not spring forward or fall back, it is constant. With this change, we added an official Swap-bot HQ clock to the upper right corner of the page. If you are ever unsure of the time in Swap-bot land, look no further.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-08-at-7.52.58-PM.png"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-08-at-7.52.58-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-06-08 at 7.52.58 PM" width="600" height="85" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11128" /></a></p>

<p>Most of us are a few hours removed from the UTC time zone, which will require some pre-planning and thoughtfulness when swapping. Swap sign ups will still close at midnight on the sign up deadline, but it will now be midnight in the UTC time zone. The same time difference will be true when we are marking swaps as sent. The time difference is not ideal, but using the international mean time is more equitable for everyone on Swap-bot until we can come up with a more sophisticated solution.</p>

<p><strong>Second,</strong> we temporarily removed Chat. It was not heavily used or very useful. We have plans to bring it back better and more engaging than ever in the coming months.</p>

<p>We are going to continue to make small tweaks to the site (and have some big ones planned), so if you see anything not working like you would expect, either leave a comment in <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/category/8">the Help Discussion Forums</a> or contact us through <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/contact.php">the admin contact form</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for you help and patience as we work to improve Swap-bot!</p>

<p>Travis and I are working on a few small site tweaks today, one of which is the new forum feature: <strong>My Discussions.</strong></p>

<p>You’ll find the “My Discussions” link in the Forums drop down menu at the top of the page. The My Discussions page will list all of the forum threads that you have ever started in order of most recent activity. Both your group and public forum threads will be listed. (If you are no longer in a group in which you previously created a forum thread, you will still see the thread listed on your My Discussions page, but won’t be able to click through to read it.)</p>

<p>I know that there are many things that need to change on Swap-bot that may be higher priorities, and we are working hard on them, but this was one feature that we could easily implement at this time. I thought it would be very helpful (for me and hopefully others) to find our past threads and see what activity we may have missed. (The feature is not perfect and there are some issues with users who have changed their usernames, but it is a start.)</p>

<p>Let me know if you notice any glitches…</p>

<p>
  I just created an off-site Swap-bot wiki where Swap-bot users and I can work together to compile helpful info about Swap-bot. Right now the Swap-bot wiki is being hosted and run on PBwiki.com. We have plans to incorporate the wiki into the main Swap-bot site eventually, but I could not wait to get it started. I know that you all have so much helpful info to share!! I think many of you know more about Swap-bot than I do! <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>

<p>
  So, what is a wiki? A wiki is a page or collection of pages on the internet designed to enable anyone who accesses it to contribute or modify content. The Swap-bot wiki is a knowledge and info center which is intended to supplement the Frequently Asked Questions and About pages. It will be a place where new and old users alike can go for current site and crafty info. Right now the wiki contains the following info ares: Frequently Asked Questions, Rules and Policies, Craft and Swap Term Glossary, and Press Room. I have only added a very small amount of info so far and we may have to reorganize it as we go, but it is a start!
</p>

<p>
  Do you want to get involved and add info to the Swap-bot wiki? Just comment here or send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com and I will email you an invitation to become a writer on the Swap-bot wiki. Writers can edit and add content to the wiki, and/or you can get email updates when the wiki is updated by others. I will be checking in on the wiki as often as possible and editing content, so don&#8217;t worry about messing any thing up.
</p>

<p>
  Ok, so let&#8217;s get started! Let me know if you want to become wiki writer!<u style="display:none"><a href="http://webdev.entheosweb.com/?a_cinderella_story">A Cinderella Story psp</a></u>

		<p>A few baby step-type site changes to tell you about…</p>

<p>The details: Founders can now make officers and members co-founders. Any founder can demote or remove another founder, but you cannot demote or remove yourself from a founder position. Also, group swaps should now still stay on the group homepage through the sign up deadline instead of being removed the day before. Finally, the list of users on the Manage Group Members page is flowing into three columns now instead of just one. That last one is a small change, but it makes viewing members a little easier.</p>

<p>BIG CHANGE: We have made a reversal of policy and now allow members to delete their own accounts. Threats of legal action led to this change. Now, when a user deletes their account ALL info (except username and past comments made throughout the site) is removed from our system completely. Deleted accounts absolutely canNOT be retrieved. However a special “address token” is created and kept in our database which prevents users from creating new accounts with the same address. So, only delete your account if you are completely sure. Fraudulent and rule breaking accounts will still be fully suspended, not deleted.</p>

		<p>I am sure everyone is aware of the “slow downs” in Swap-bot service that we have been experiencing periodically. We have been having difficulty with our current web hosting service and are in the process of switching to a higher capacity service. The final switch to the new server will happen tonight. The switch will require about 15 minutes of downtime which will occur at approximately 10 pm US Pacific time TONIGHT. I am sorry for the inconvenience, but it is necessary.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the switch there are some significant changes that you will notice on Swap-bot. There will be a few layout changes and a few feature additions – including a swap “watch list.” Mostly you will hopefully just notice that the site is running much quicker. More info about the site changes will be released soon. Please have patience as there will surely be a few little glitches as the changes are implemented.</p>

<p>Also, Travis and I are doing our best on this site. I wish we could provide the kind of service we all expect from large sites like Facebook or MySpace, but frankly, we cannot. I am extremely (disgracefully) behind on answering support email, but I am trying to catch up. I am sorry. We really enjoy running this site and providing a fun tool, but we must do it on our own terms. If it is no longer fun for you to use or visit, I am sorry. Like usual, I will suggest using groups if your want to interact with an exclusive set of users.</p>

<p>Ok, so thanks for your patience as we switch to the new server. It is a big job, so wish us luck!!</p>

		<p>Swap-bot is ever-changing and we have some new improvements to tell you about:</p>

<p><em style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?air_force_one">Air Force One movie</a></em> &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Biggest Deal – There is now a “latest discussions” for all of your group forums. When you go to Group Forums Home you will now see a list of the 25 most recent forum conversations from all of the groups you belong to. (Sticky conversations are listed first.) The latest group discussions take the place of the simple list of group names that used to be on the Group Forums Home. There is also now a link to your group forums on the public forums sidebar.</li>
  <li>Woot woot! There are now a couple of group email notifications! You will now receive email notifications whenever a new swap is created in one of the groups you belong to. You will also receive an email when a new announcement is posted in any of your groups. (Announcements are the comments listed on the group homepage. The idea is that founders and officers could use the announcements section to post things that they would like to notify the entire group about.) Both of these email notifications are completely optional. You can choose which type of emails you would like to receive for each group. Go to the new “Groups” link within the “Profile Edit” page in order to set your group email preferences. The default is set so that you DO receive ALL of the group email notifications.</li>
  <li>Speaking of editing your profile, in addition to the “edit” link at the top of most Swap-bot pages there is now a new link on your profile page that will take you to the edit screen. Some users were having trouble finding the profile edit page, so hopefully this will make it easier.</li>
</ul>

		<p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2008-03-02T07:06:42-05:00" itemprop="datePublished">Mar 2, 2008</time> • <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">rachel</span></span></p>

	<div>
		<p>We have been working on a few small site changes this weekend. Here are the details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Swap partners are no longer auto assigned. This has been a confusing subject mostly due to my own mistakes and bad info, however we have now come to a solution which we believe will be most effective. Coordinators are now completely responsible for assigning partners for their swaps. The Swap-bot computer will NOT auto-assign partners at any time. Coordinators have one week (7 days) to assign partners for their swaps. If partners are not assigned within one week the swap is DELETED by the Swap-bot computer. All participants will receive an email letting them know that the swap was deleted. 
<em style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?air_force_one">Air Force One on dvd</a></em> Side note: If a swap has been deleted because the coordinator has not logged in for over a week and never assigned partners, we consider it perfectly acceptable for one of the swap’s participants to start a similar swap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You can now drop from swaps at any time before partners are assigned. Before you could not drop from a swap if the sign up deadline had passed, now you can drop after the sign up deadline if partners are not assigned.</li>
  <li>I have revised the FAQ to reflect these changes, but as always let me know if you notice any errors.</li>
  <li>One more little change for group founders: We have added the date that users requested to join a group under their info on the group “Approve Join Requests” pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you like these changes. Happy swapping!</p>

<p>UPDATE: My wording above may be slightly confusing. Coordinators do not actually have to pair up the participants in their swaps, they simply have to initiate the process by clicking the “assign partners” link. The Swap-bot computer still matches all partners. It just does not ever initiate that process automatically. Sorry for any confusion.<strong style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?hondo">Hondo dvdrip</a></strong></p>

		<p>We finally just jumped in and did it – we have publicly released the Swap-bot Groups system. The system is still a bit clunky and definitely not perfect, but if we waited for perfection nothing would ever get done!</p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://cigaretteshere.biz/" title="buy cigarettes online">buy cigarettes online</a>
</div>

<p>So, what does this mean? It means that everyone can now (easily) create and search for groups! The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/index.php">“Find Groups”</a> link is now located on the left sidebar of non-forum Swap-bot pages. There you can search for groups that match your interests and go to their homepage to request to join. Or, you can create your own group! Have fun!</p>

<p><strong>GENERAL GROUP INFO</strong></p>

<p>Swap-bot groups were created to better enhance the swapping community. You can create groups around any interest, demographic or anything you choose! Multiple groups may be created that address similar interests. That is ok. Everyone is free to create any groups they want. However, kindness and consideration are always appreciated. If you plan to create a group that is identical to one already in existence, it would be best to contact the other group’s founder first…</p>

<p><strong>Membership Levels</strong></p>

<p>There are three different levels of group membership:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Member:</strong> Group Members join group swaps and participate in the group-specific forum.</li>
  <li><strong>Officer:</strong> Group Officers have the same privileges as Group Members, plus they can create group swaps and invite other Swap-bot members to their group.</li>
  <li><strong>Founder:</strong> Group Founders have the same privileges as Group Officers, plus they can approve group join requests, remove Members or Officers from the group, promote or demote Members and Officers. In addition, Group Founders have swap coordinator privileges for any group swaps (even if they did not create the swap). At this time each group can only have one founder. In the future we hope to make it so that there can be multiple founders.</li>
</ol>

<p>FYI: In the future we hope to make the group membership levels more fluid and changeable…</p>

<p><strong>Groups Swaps</strong></p>

<p>Only those Swap-bot members that belong to the group can join a group swap. (The Swap-bot computer prevents non-members from signing up.) Group swaps are not listed on the public search page or any of the swap lists. However, group swaps are listed on member profile pages and are not meant to be hidden from non group members.</p>

<p><strong>Accepting new members</strong></p>

<p>In addition to forming niche swapping communities, Groups can be used to ensure you only swap with other members you trust. If you are a Founder or Officer in a group it is your responsibility to the group to ensure that only trustworthy swappers make it into your group. <em>Swap-bot admin cannot help with any group conflicts.</em></p>

<p>—–</p>

<p>We are very excited about Swap-bot Groups… but it has proven to be a much larger endeavor than first thought. There is still much work to be done. Please explore the system and give us any feedback you have. Like all of Swap-bot, Groups are an evolving and constantly improving entity.</p>

<p>The Group Beta Testers have been an awesome help. They have given us tons of suggestions, many of which we are still working to implement. If you are a member of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/30b241498eececb662539242308e5c6e/about">Swap-bot Beta Testers group</a></p>

<p>, please go to the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/30b241498eececb662539242308e5c6e/about">homepage</a> for information about adding a special beta tester badge to your profile.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone for your help and patience!</p>

<p>Happy swapping,</p>

<p>Rachel</p>

<p>Swap-bot Admin</p>

		<p>I have a few updates to tell you about…</p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://cheapbuycigarettesonline.com/" title="buy cigarettes">buy cigarettes</a>
</div>

<p>1 – “Your Swaps” has been changed to “My Swaps”. It is just a word change and the link still goes to the same page. It is a change which lays the ground work for the site to be consistent as we add features in future.</p>

<p>2 – We have implemented a new user swap sign up limit. All new users of Swap-bot now start with a five swap limit. They can only sign up for five active swaps at a time at first. This limit lasts until they have received three positive (5) ratings from their swap partners. Once they have received three positive ratings, the swap sign up limit is completely removed and they can sign up for as many swaps as they would like. This is the first time we have implemented any type of swap limit, so we may make adjustments as we receive feedback. Also, this new feature is not retroactive.</p>

<p>3 – Swap-bot Groups are slowly being tested and released. To learn about being a group beta tester <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/6077">go here</a></p>

<div style="display:none">
  <a href="http://utero.pe/?the_omen">The Omen film</a>
</div>

<p>. There will be much more info about groups provided once we get closer to officially releasing the system. They will basically be a way to organize swapping and chatting among communities with similar interests. Any members with over five “5” ratings will be able to create groups, and each group will have a home page, private forum, and group-only swaps. Pretty cool. We are excited about the possibilities!</p>

<p>4 – The [FAQ page]((http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php) <em style="display:none"><a href="http://www.turtlesurvival.org/?jumper">Jumper full</a></em> is constantly being updated, so check it out when you have questions. If you don’t see your question there, please let me know so that we can add it.</p>

<p>Ok, that is about it for now… but stay tuned for info and announcements about GROUPS!</p>

		<p>Hi swap buddies!</p>

<p>Just wanted to let everyone know that we have created a few new swap and forum categories. Here are the additions we made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New “Ephemera” swap category</li>
  <li>New “Children’s Items” swap category</li>
  <li>New “Tag and Trade Problems” forum sub-category under the “One-on-One Trades” main category</li>
</ul>
<div style="display: none">

</div>

<ul>
  <li>New “Real Life/Off Topic” forum sub-category under the “Fun” main category</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all in response to user suggestions. Thanks for all of your help!</p>

<p>Also, we are currently working on a new user swap limit and a groups feature which will hopefully both be released in some capacity on Sunday. For more info on the groups feature, check out <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/5870">this forum thread</a>.</p>

		<p>We have been working hard this weekend to release some pretty cool site updates for you today. The site changes/improvements are listed below. Check them out and let us know how you like them or if you notice anything weird going on. Thanks! xoxo</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Most important:</strong> The <a href="http://swap-bot.com/blog/2007/11/24/automatic-account-suspensions/">automatic account suspension system</a> is now completely operational. This means that if a swapper receives four, or more, “1” ratings within the past six months, their account is automatically partially suspended by the Swap-bot computer. They are dropped from all swaps in which partners are not yet assigned and they are not able to sign up for new swaps until they get their low ratings rectified. This means that if you have four, or more, “1” ratings from the past six months on your account right now, you will not be allowed to sign up for any new swaps until you are able to improve some of those ratings.</li>
  <li>There are three new email notifications that you will be receiving: (1) when/if your account is partially suspended due to four, or more, “1” ratings; (2) when a rating you have given receives a response; (3) when you receive a comment on your profile. The last two email notifications have been requested by many users, but we have also made them optional if you prefer. To “opt out” of the rating response and profile comment email notifications, go to the new <strong>Preferences</strong> section of the profile edit screen. You can also choose not to receive the email notification for new ratings on this screen. The default is set so that you DO receive all email notifications. You must edit your profile preferences to stop receiving any of the three optional notifications. (Many Swap-bot email notifications, such as those for swap deadlines, are not optional at this time.)</li>
  <li>Your country is now listed on your profile page under last login. This is NOT optional at this time. Your country is listed exactly as you typed it in you account address.</li>
  <li>Your current swaps on the “Your Swaps” page are now listed by mail deadline instead of sign up deadline. This makes it so that the “Your Swaps” list matches the “Currently In” list on the profile pages.</li>
  <li>You can now mark swaps as NOT sent if/when you accidentally mark them as “Sent” before you mean to. This option is located in the swap’s info box on the swap’s main page to the right of the “Sent Items Status:” field. You cannot perform this option from the “Your Swaps” page; you must view the individual swap page to do it.</li>
  <li>The date that each participant marked a swap as “Sent” is now visible on the “View complete list of swap participants” page. This information is visible for both participants and coordinators of the swap. However, this new bit of information cannot be displayed retroactively, so all swaps that have been marked “Sent” prior to today will not have a date associated with them. Sorry.</li>
  <li>Lastly, the list of recipients you have sent messages to in the Swap-bot message center are now listed in alphabetical order. However, the alphabetical ordering system is not perfect as users who have not logged in for months (and still only have their old display names) are not sorted alphabetically. Their names will appear at the end of the list.</li>
</ul>

<p><u style="display:none">[Secrecy download](http://www.barryshamis.com/?secrecy)</u></p>

<p>We hope you enjoy the new changes. Happy swapping!</p>

	<div>
		<p>We have just released a few site changes. We added total number of completed swaps to everyoneâ€™s profiles and we changed it so that the swaps you are currently hosting are not removed from the corresponding profile list until the mail deadline has passed. (Travis also made some changes that should speed up the entire site a bit.) However, the most important change is the addition of an **automatic account suspension system**.</p>

<p>This computerized system will automatically partially suspend questionable swappers if they compile too many **”1″** (did not receive swap items) ratings. Partial suspensions means that the user is dropped from all open swaps (in which partners have not been assigned) and the user is no longer able to sign up for new swaps. They can still complete current swaps and leave ratings, and when/if they reduce their number of â€œ1â€³ ratings their account will automatically be UN-suspended.</p>

<p>Right now the suspension criteria used by the system is very lenient. Only users who have received **ten** â€œ1â€³ ratings in the last six months will be automatically suspended. We plan to change this criteria soon, but we wanted to give everyone a heads up that the system is now in place before implementing the actual criteria. In a week, or so, we will change the automatic suspension criteria to just **four** â€œ1â€³ ratings in the last six months. If your account fits this criteria, I would suggest trying to rectify some of your bad ratings. Contact old swap partners and re-send packages if necessary. I believe that four â€œ1â€³ ratings is still quite lenient, but we will see how the system plays out before making it more strict.</p>

<p>Also, if you have over a 4.9 rating you will never be considered by the computer for the automatic suspension. However, anyone with under a 4.9 rating and who has had four “1” ratings in the last six months will be partially suspended. We added this high rating “safety” so that users who participate in many, many swaps have more leniency in the number of “1”s they can have on their account at any given time. (FYI: A user has to have completed almost 200 swaps in order to “beat” the system with a 4.9 rating.)</p>

<p>Thank you all for your feedback on this issue. (Check out the original discussion of this feature <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/4607/">here</a>.)<u style="display:none">[Barbie as the Island Princess dvd](http://utero.pe/?barbie_as_the_island_princess)</u></p>

<p>There is a cute new feature you might want to check out. We now have a selection of pre-made avatars for you to choose from. You can pick one of the avatar options by going to the Profile Edit page and then clicking on “Picture”. We plan to keep adding to the pre-made selection over time. Of course, you can still upload your own avatar from your computer, but we realized that many people were having a bit of trouble re-sizing and/or creating avatars. This makes it quick and easy for new users to pick an avatar for their profile. You can still change your avatar image at any time.

	</header>
	<div>
		<p>In order to improve the safety, fairness, and overall efficiency of Swap-bot, we have implemented a few major policy changes.</p>

<p><strong>Usernames</strong> <em style="display:none"><a href="http://blog.segd.org/?hellboy_animated_sword_of_storms">Hellboy Animated: Sword of Storms divx</a></em></p>

<p>The first thing that you will notice is that we are switching to unique, static usernames to replace the old display names. When you next log into Swap-bot you will be asked to choose a username. Please choose carefully as usernames are unchangeable and will stay with your account forever. After picking your username it will replace your old display name throughout the entire Swap-bot site and you will be able to use it to log into Swap-bot from then on. Usernames may only consist of letters and numbers. Other characters, offensive words, and any HTML or Markdown code are not allowed in usernames. Each person’s username must be unique. We suggest picking a username that is close to your old display name so that other members will be able to easily recognize you.</p>

<p>We know that this change will cause some confusion at first. We are sorry for any inconvenience, but this change is necessary as Swap-bot continues to grow. You might want to list your old display name in your profile somewhere if your username is significantly different. We expect all of our users to pick their new usernames fairly and to not misrepresent their identity in any manner. If you have any problems with the new username feature, please contact us at questions[at]swap-bot.com.</p>

<p><strong>Unique Addresses</strong></p>

<p>From this point on, each individual is only allowed <strong>one</strong> Swap-bot account. Every new account must have a unique address, as well as a unique username and email address. We have implemented new computerized strategies for assuring the uniqueness of each new user’s identity. We no longer allow (nor did we ever encourage) members to create multiple accounts.</p>

<p>Another major change is that you are no longer able to delete your account. If you wish to leave Swap-bot you can remove all of your address info and terminate Swap-bot communications, but your username and rating history will always be visible. <strong>This means that your current Swap-bot account is your only Swap-bot account!</strong> You will not be able to scrap it and start a new one if you get bad ratings.</p>

<p>These changes are unfortunately not retroactive. If you currently have multiple accounts you will not be punished. However, if you are observed behaving dishonestly or abusing the system, one, or all, of your accounts may be partially or fully suspended.</p>

<p>If you are a new user who would like to participate in Swap-bot but you have the same address as a current member, you must contact Swap-bot Admins to discuss exceptions to the unique address policy. You can email us at questions[at]swap-bot.com. Family members and roommates currently using Swap-bot with the same address should not be affected by the new policy. However, if you encounter any problems while trying to edit your address please contact us.</p>

<p><strong>Editing Your Profile</strong></p>

<p>You will notice that the links to edit your profile and manage your account have disappeared. You can now edit all of the information related to your account and your visible profile by clicking on the word <strong>(edit)</strong> next to the <strong>Profile</strong> link at the top of most Swap-bot pages. The profile editing system has now been divided into a few different categories to make editing a bit simpler. Let us know if you have any questions or encounter any problems.</p>

<p>We know these changes will make Swap-bot more efficient and fair. Thank you for your patience and understanding while they are being implemented.</p>

		<p>If you are looking for updated Swap-bot site info there are now a few places to find it! The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page has been updated and lengthened, and we finally put together a more comprehensive <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/terms.php">Terms of Use</a> policy. The Terms of Use is fairly generic – we won’t share your info, you are responsible for your actions, etc – but you might want to take a look at it anyway. We have also created a new <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/about.php">ABOUT</a> page which contains a list of DOs and DON’Ts. I want to continue to add to those lists and I need your help! Please list any suggestions you have for Swap-bot DOs and DON’Ts in the comments. I can’t promise to use all of them, but together we can make sure we cover all the important stuff. Thanks!</p>

		<p>Travis worked hard making a few improvements to the site this weekend. Here is what has been improved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is now a “games” category for swaps. You select up to three swap categories when creating each swap, and you can search by category on the “View all swaps” page.</li>
  <li>The image uploading problem when editing newly created swaps should now be fixed. You should have no problem uploading .jpgs, .gifs, or .pngs to represent your swaps now.</li>
  <li>The account self deletion option should now be working correctly. If you choose to delete your account (permanently) you can now click on the link at the very bottom of the “Edit Profile” page and, if you are not in any open swaps, your account will automatically be deleted. Previously this option had a few bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let us know if you notice any problems with these three improvements. Thanks!</p>

		<p>We have finally updated the rating system! Here are the two main changes:</p>

<p>The top rating option (5) now becomes available immediately. Meaning that as soon as partners are assigned for each swap, the top rating option is available to be marked. So, now you can give your partners a “5” (and a heart) as soon as their package arrives. The two lower rating options (3 and 1) do not become available until two weeks after the mail deadline for each swap. This is a bit of a change. All of the rating options used to become available one week after the mail deadline for each swap. We have had many, many requests for immediate rating capabilities. Please check out the new system and let us know how it is working.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/star.png" alt="star.png" />The second big change is that we have implemented the Coordinator Star system! This is a slightly complicated system, but it is a nice way to reward hard working coordinators. Now, when you open the rating window for each swap there is a Coordinator Star box. In that box you can mark either that your coordinator deserves a star, or they do NOT deserve a star. Coordinators do not receive a star for every person who marks yes to the star option, instead they must receive stars from 75% of the <em>rating</em> participants in their swap. Meaning that of the people in the swap who give one of the two ratings for the coordinator, 75% must mark the positive option for a star to be received. If a participant does not rate at all they are not included in the equation. Also, coordinators canNOT be hurt by this system. They can only <em>receive</em> stars, not have them deducted.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> My previous statement about the stars is somewhat confusing and inaccurate. The number of stars you receive can change as more members from each of the swaps you host rate you. If the percentage of participants who rate you positively for each swap drops below 75% at any time, you will lose the star for that swap. What I meant to say above is that if more than 75% of people in a swap rate you negatively, that does not hurt you. You simply do not receive a star for that swap. (It does not create a negative star.)</p>

<p>I hope that explains things a bit better!</p>

<p>I hope that makes the new rating changes somewhat clear. Try them out and let us know if you have any questions.<u style="display:none">[Motel Hell rip](http://londongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/?motel_hell)</u></p>

<p>Most of you have probably already figured this out, but we just created a new swap search menu. If you go to the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/search.php">“View all swaps”</a> <strong style="display:none"><a href="http://funwish.net/?fatal_blade">Fatal Blade the movie</a></strong> page, there are now a bunch of new options at the top of the page that you can use to find swaps. You can still browse the swaps by category, but now you can also sort the list by creation date, sign up date, and mail date. The best part is that you can now use the search box in the top right to type in words to find swaps. Try it out.</p>

<p>We also added a little box on the far right that shows how many swaps meet your search criteria. Right now there are a total of 335 swaps to search! wow!</p>

<p>Have fun. Let us know how the new searching works out.</p>

		<p>I am very excited to announce the new layout of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4">profile pages</a>! We spent quite a while trying to decide how to organize all of the things that we wanted to include on the pages, and we finally settled on an arrangement that we hope you like…</p>

<p>You will now notice that in the upper right corner there is a designated ratings box. Here you will find the user’s average rating, their number of hearts, and soon you will be able to see their number of stars. Stars will be used to indicate exceptional swap coordination (for hosts/hostesses), but that feature is not ready quite yet.</p>

<p>The full list of a user’s ratings is still located at the bottom of the profile information, but there is one exciting addition to the ratings – you can now RESPOND to any rating given to you! Your response will show up in a gray box beneath the rating. Many users have been requesting this feature for a while, and I am very excited to see how it works out.</p>

<p><img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/picture-2.png" alt="picture-2.png" /></p>

<p>Another exciting new feature we added to the profiles is a comment section. Here any Swap-bot users can leave comments on your profile. It is separate from the messaging system and we thought it would be a great way for swappers to thank their partners in a semi-public way. It is also an easy way to communicate.</p>

<p><img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/picture-3.png" alt="picture-3.png" /></p>

<p>We know that there may be a few bugs to work out on the new profile pages, so please notify us if you see anything weird. Also, the profile pages are now 910 pixels wide, meaning that some of you using lower resolution computer screens may have to scroll horizontally to see the whole thing. We are sorry about that inconvenience, but there was just no way to include so much info in such a small area. All in all we hope you love the new layout and enjoy the new features. We will continually try to improve and update Swap-bot to make it more fun and easy to use. xoxo</p>

<p>UPDATE: I forgot to add an explanation about the lists of “Currently In” and “Currently Hosting” swaps (On the right side of the new profile pages). The “Currently In” list shows all of the swaps you are currently signed up for in which you have NOT yet marked as sent. The “Currently Hosting” list contains all of the swaps you coordinated that have not closed yet. Meaning that other swapper can still sign up for them.<em style="display:none"></em></p>

		<p><img id="image38" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/bigheart.png" alt="bigheart.png" />What is this little heart? It happens to be the newest feature of the Swap-bot rating system. Ratings are still based on the 5 point system, but now there is a way to re <a href="http://saveyourmoney.on-blog.com/2013/02/17/full-mind-control/" title="Full Mind Control">Full Mind Control</a> ward those swappers who really go above and beyond the swap expectations. You know the swappers I am talking about – the ones who send you those super-adorable swap packages, all decorated and filled with extra goodies, or the ones who look at your profile and manage to send you just the PERFECT item. Now you can give those special swappers a heart for being so wonderful.</p>

<p>This is what the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/rating_info.php">rating info page</a> now says about the heart system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If someone sends you an extra special swap package that far exceeds the swap requirements, you can give that person a heart. The option to give someone a heart only appears when you give them the highest rating (“I got my stuff and it met posted swap requirements”). Under this rating option a check box will appear that you can mark if you want to give a heart. You do not have to give anyone a heart just because you gave them the highest rating. We suggest that you reserve giving hearts to those swappers who you think deserve even more than the highest rating (more than 5 points). The number of hearts a person has collected will be shown on their profile page next to their average rating. Lots of hearts indicates a very special swapper!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, don’t fret, you can go back to your old swaps and retro-actively give hearts to anyone who previously sent you awesome swaps!</p>

<p>See how many hearts you can collect!</p>

		<p>We [released a few new feature upgrades](http://swap-bot.com/blog/2007/01/20/new-new-new/) yesterday and of all of them, I am most excited about the [new way coordinators assign swap partners](http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php#question17). I feel like we have taken a positive step forward in eliminating bad swappers from participating in [Swap-bot](http://www.swap-bot.com/).</p>

<p>The idea of making coordinators manually start the partner assignment process is something I have been working on for quite a while. Before this change, the process was automatic. As soon as the deadline to signup passed, partners were instantly assigned. The problem we were running into, however, is that the scammers discovered that they could sign up an hour before the partners were assigned, which wouldn’t leave enough time for the coordinator to ban them. While I feel very strongly that we have a great community of swappers, **the average rating given is a 4.6**, I am aware that even one bad apple will ruin the swap for someone. After many email discussions with helpful members of the Swap-bot community, I came up with the process we released yesterday. The coordinator now has three days manually initiate the partner assignment process. If, after three days, the coordinator hasn’t assigned partners, Swap-bot will automatically assign the partners for the coordinator.</p>

<p>Swap coordinators should already be aware of this change, an email went out to the those that are in charge of swaps that ended yesterday alerting them that it was time to initiate the assignment process. I just checked and 4 of the 20 swaps that closed signup yesterday have already had their partners assigned.</p>

<p>![Assign Partners](http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/assign_partners.png)</p>

<p>Assigning partners in Swap-bot is very easy. After signup has closed for the swap, the coordinator should return to Swap-bot to view the final list of signed up swap participants. If any of the participants do not meet swap requirements, such as minimum rating, geographical location or any other requirement, the coordinator can ban the participant from the swap and ensure that they will not be assigned a partner. Once the coordinator is happy with the final list of participants, they can simply click on the ‘Assign partners for this swap’ link.</p>

<p>Assigning partners adds a few minutes of work for the coordinator, but I feel it will greatly enhance the swap experience for all participants. I hope you agree. Any feedback on this feature would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Swap-bot finally has a new look! We remodeled the home page and added a rotating selection of images from <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> that all have the tag “swapbot”. Check it out! (If you still want to see the original home page, don’t worry, it is right <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/info.php">here</a>.) The rest of Swap-bot is still pretty much the same… with the addition of the awesome new messaging system.</p>

<p>Your faithful and intrepid <a href="http://www.eightfivethree.com/">Swap-bot webmaster</a> is busy working on lots of new ideas for the site. Look for updates in the swap search system and the swap image gallery in the near future.</p>

		<p>We just released some great new features for Swap-bot!</p>

<p>You can now send Messages to all of your buddies and swap partners via the Swap-bot web messaging system. Now, when you contact other members a message is sent to their inbox on Swap-bot.com. After logging in, you can check your messages by clicking on the link at the top of the Swap-bot page.</p>

<p>In order to cut down on bad swappers signing up for swaps at the last minute (when it is too late for coordinators to ban them), we have made it so that every coordinator has a chance to check over the final list of swap participants before partners are assigned. It is now the coordinators’ responsibility to initiate the partner assignment process. See <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php#question17">question 17 of the FAQs</a> for more info.</p>

<p>You might have also noticed that the Swap-bot Blog got a little face-lift. We are planning on updating this blog MUCH more often about changes and updates to swap-bot. I am also going to start featuring a cool swap every week on the blog. Look for the “Weekly Featured Swap” to be posted every Sunday.</p>

<p>We hope you like the new features! Please keep us posted about things you would like to see on Swap-bot. We love to hear your feedback!<u style="display:none">[City of Joy buy](http://utero.pe/?city_of_joy)</u></p>
