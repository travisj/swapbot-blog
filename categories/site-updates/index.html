		<p>Last weekend we made some infrastructure updates and <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2014/06/08/updating-swap-bot-hq-time-zone/">we also switched the site to the UTC time zone</a>. You all (our users) have been SO COOL and helpful regarding the time zone change. Travis and I were extremely impressed with your willingness to roll with the change and we really appreciate all of the feedback.</p>

<p>And your reward? More confusion! Ugh. Sorry. We know this is a little crazy… but…</p>

<p><strong>Today we switched Swap-bot back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone">US Pacific Time</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Swap-bot was originally created in the Pacific time zone (years ago) and in listening to your feedback and concerns about UTC time, we feel that this will be a good solution. Putting the site in Pacific Time will mean that most of the world will be AHEAD of official Swap-bot time. This will give everyone (except for those in Hawaii and Alaska) a little extra leniency and time when signing up for and sending swaps. Unfortunately, it will also mean that our international swappers will have to wait a little longer (according to their local time) to assign swap partners.</p>

<p>The time zone issue is tricky and confusing since each international swap is technically being coordinated simultaneously across the globe. But being in Pacific Time will mean that very, very few swappers will ever have to worry about their swap being marked late (if they send on time in their own time zone). The corner “Swap-bot Time” clock will stay, and we hope to add some info explaining why it may be different than your current time zone.</p>

<p>Thank you again for all of your help and patience. Please continue to keep us posted with any questions or concerns.</p>

		<p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2011-03-14T04:15:11-04:00" itemprop="datePublished">Mar 14, 2011</time> • <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">rachel</span></span></p>

	<div>
		<p>A few small site changes were made over the weekend. Here are the details:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>We added a Type section to the Rating Overview on everyone’s profile page.</strong> You can now see the number of swaps each member has completed according to their swap Type.
    <ul>
      <li>Type 1: Electronic swaps – internet-based, email, messages, links, digital photography, etc</li>
      <li>Type 2: Flat mail – postcards, letters, mail swaps that require one stamp (store-bought postcards would go in this type)</li>
      <li>Type 3: Crafts &amp; Packages – any time-intensive crafts, packages, most swaps will fall in this category</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Right now, these numbers do not have any functionality (i.e. you can’t click on them to see a list of the completed swaps), but we hope to keep working on this feature. We hope that seeing the number of completed swaps for each Type will help coordinators determine who to allow in their swaps. As for the uncategorized swaps, Types were <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/36261/">introduced in May 2009</a> and any swaps completed before then were not “Typed.” However, swap coordinators can go back and “Type” their old swaps by going to the “Edit the swap” page. &lt;/li&gt;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><em>Based on user suggestions, we have now implemented a <strong>rating lock after six months</strong>. Each swap is “closed” six months after the send deadline. Previously, that just meant that everyone’s addresses were removed from view in that swap, but now it also means that it is no longer possible for any of the participants to leave a 1 or 3 rating for the swap. This change will prevent users from rating unfairly long after a swap has been completed. You will still be able to leave a 5 rating, or to choose the “I do not wish to rate at this time” option indefinitely. That means that users can still remove a low rating or change it to a 5 at any time. (It also means that potentially a 5 rating can be removed (by choosing the “I do not wish to rate” option), but I think that would be a very rare occurrence.) We still want to allow some flexibility in the rating system so that old swaps can be made up and mistakes can be changed. FYI: Users have noted that this changes makes it impossible to change a 1 rating to a 3 after six months (like, say, if a returning flaker has come back and is trying to make up swaps). I agree that this could be a problem. Join in the discussion about this new feature <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/69563">here in the forums</a>. Together we can work toward the best solution.</em> 
**UPDATE 5/12/2011: We have removed the time limit on leaving low ratings. We have reverted the system back to its original functionality. You can now leave any of the three ratings at any time (except for the usual two week wait after the mail deadline for the 1 and 3). &lt;/p&gt;</p>

        <p>The six month limit on when you could leave low ratings was intended to prevent users from changing good ratings to low ratings. Unfortunately, it seems to have only caused problems with rating swappers who have returned after a long swap break and are trying to make up past unsent swaps.</p>

        <p>We would like to implement a way to “lock in” 5 ratings in the future, but we are still considering the best way to do it. For now, if you have problems with a user changing a previous 5 rating, contact me – rachel [at] swap-bot.com. It is a rare occurrence and I can lock ratings manually as needed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/li&gt;</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>On group home pages we have now reduced the number of mini user avatars that appear in the bottom right column.</strong> The avatars took forever to load on groups with lots and lots of members, so now you will only see a maximum of 100 random members on the homepage. This is not a big change, but we don’t want you to worry that you suddenly lost a bunch of group members!&lt;/ul&gt;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That is it for now. Let me know if you have any questions!</p>

		<p>Many of you noticed that Swap-bot was acting sluggish over the last week. Also, most of the email alerts have not been getting sent. Today, we are working on correcting those issues, as well as improving things on the backend which will help the site run faster.</p>

<p>You may have already noticed some weird things happening today and there may continue to be some short outages. Our plan is to have everything corrected and improved by the end of the day. We are sorry for any confusion. Thank you for sticking with us!</p>

		<p>Travis and I were working on the Swap-bot site yesterday. You may have noticed a few glitches overnight, but things should be back to normal today.</p>

<p>In addition to some much-needed text editing, we released three new major changes:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ratingfilterscreenshot.png" alt="ratingfilterscreenshot" title="ratingfilterscreenshot" width="470" height="147" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5523" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rating Filter for Swaps</strong> – As part of our overall plan to make hosting swaps easier, we have implemented an optional rating filter for swaps. Now, when a coordinator creates a new swap, they have the option to choose an automatic rating filter. (The image above show how the new option appears on the swap creation page.) Hosts can now enter a rating limit (say, 4.8) and participants will automatically be screened according to that limit. If a user does not meet the rating requirement, they will not be able to enter the swap. 
Hosts can also choose whether they want to allow new users with no ratings in the swap. If the “Manual rating filter” option is picked, the swap will proceed as usual and any unsuspended user will be able to sign up. Hosts will then need to manually suspend any users who do not meet their requirements. Even if the auto rating filter is used, we still strongly suggest that hosts still check over their participant lists before assigning partner to check for profile or address issues.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Country Standardization</strong> – We have started the process of standardizing all countries within member addresses. 90% of all users’ countries have already been standardized automatically, but you may be asked to pick a country from a drop down list when you next log into Swap-bot. The standardization of countries will allow us to start working on an automatic location filtering system for regional swaps. Look for that feature when creating swaps in the near future!</li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>New User Limit Changes</strong> – We have tightened the new user swap sign up limit slightly: All new users of Swap-bot start with a swap sign up limit and can only sign up for five swaps at a time at first. This limit lasts until they have completed five swaps (i.e. marked them all as “Sent” once their packages are in the mail) and received five positive (5) ratings from their swap partners. (The ratings can be from five individual swaps or all from one swap with multiple partners.) Once a user has met these requirements, the limit is removed and they can sign up for as many as twenty swaps at a time. 
Previously, the five swap sign up limit only lasted until the user received <strong>three</strong> “5” ratings. We noticed that some scammers were quickly getting around the limit by signing up for one e-swap with many partners. Hopefully, this change will slow them down and give us time to catch them before damage is done. The change should not affect experienced users, except for the fact that it will help make swapping a little bit safer. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</p>

        <p>These changes are not very drastic and we have edited the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php">FAQ</a> and other text pages to reflect the new info. As always, let us know if you have any questions or notice any problems.</p>
      </li>

	<div>
		<p>We have finally released the new swap coordinator requirements that were previously discussed in the forums . We made these changes to the requirements after receiving a lot of user input about who should be able to host a swap on Swap-bot. These changes will probably not affect any long-time users, but they will change how and when new users can host swaps.</p>

<p>Starting now, you must meet these requirements in order to create any swap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must complete five different swaps (i.e. send and mark five swaps as sent).</li>
  <li>You must have received five 5 ratings (they can be for the same swap, or different swaps).</li>
  <li>You must have LESS than ten 1 ratings in your entire Swap-bot lifetime.</li>
</ul>

<p>And, like always:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must have over a 3.0 average rating.</li>
  <li>You must NOT be suspended in any way (partially of fully) or be underage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any swaps that are already underway will not be affected by this change. I believe these new restrictions will help increase the overall average quality level of swaps hosted on Swap-bot. These restrictions are not perfect – other types of restrictions have been suggested, like restricting each type of swap individually – but I think they are a good start. They are much more strict than the previous requirement of just completing one swap!</p>

<p>Like always, we can override these restrictions if there are new users who have past swapping experience and would like to start hosting on Swap-bot. We still want Swap-bot to be a helpful tool for those who host successful swaps on their blogs, so I will continue to make exceptions for those types of swaps as needed.</p>

<p>Also, these restrictions are probably a lot more lenient than what many Swap-bot users look for in their swap coordinators. Remember to always check out the swap’s host before signing up for a swap. You can set your own personal coordinator requirements and only join swaps hosted by users who meet them. A good swap host makes for a successful swap!</p>

<p>When you next log into Swap-bot, you may notice two new additions to the Dashboard.</p>

<p>First, we have added a drop down menu under the Dashboard link so that you can get to your different swap lists more quickly.</p>

<p>Second, we have created a new list within your Dashboard just for your hosted swaps. All of the current and previous swaps that you have hosted will be listed there. If you have not hosted any swaps, you will not have a “Hosting” Dashboard section.</p>

<p>We still have a lot of work to do on the site navigation and organization, but this is one small step in the right direction! Enjoy!</p>

		<p>Last night we switched Swap-bot to new servers and made a few minor changes to the site. We did not make any major adjustments, so hopefully you will not experience any problems, but let us know if you notice anything odd.</p>

<p>So, what all did we do? Let me explain…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New Servers!</strong> – Travis (the web programming side of the Swap-bot team) assures me that the new server set up will provide three times our previous processing power, which is really important as the site grows. There are also a lot of technical benefits to the new servers which makes Travis happy… and that makes me happy! 
<strong>UPDATE: Travis is still messing around with the servers (as of 2:30 EST) which is causing everyone to get logged out and making things slow. He should be done soon.</strong> &lt;/li&gt;</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time Zone Change</strong> – With the change to the new servers, we also had to change the entire site to US East Coast time. This will affect swap sign up and send deadlines slightly. We are still observing how the new time zone will work for everyone, so let us know if it causes any problems. The switch to East Coast time also affected the forum post time stamps, setting all of the post made before last night back three hours. Not a big deal, but it might have been confusing this morning if you were searching for a specific post made at a specific time yesterday.</li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>FACEBOOK</strong> – Do you use Facebook? You can now integrate your swap activity with your Facebook wall and news feed! Sweet! Now, after you sign up for a new swap, a box will appear at the top of your dashboard asking you to connect to Facebook. If you would like to, simply click on the Facebook Connect button and then type in your Facebook login info. Once you have entered your Facebook info the first time you will always have the option of publishing each of your swap sign ups to your Facebook wall. Your friends will be able to follow your swap activity and click on the swap link to sign up for the same swap if they would like. Your swap activity will look like this on your Facebook wall:
<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-1.png" alt="picture-1" title="picture-1" width="513" height="132" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-864" /></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Swap Types</strong> – When you create swaps from now on, in addition to all of the usual info, you will be asked to pick a swap type. There are three swap types (email, letter, package) which I will describe below. This additional information will help us give a more detailed and descriptive rating overview for all participants. Beginning to gather the swap type info during swap creation is laying the groundwork for future additions to the rating system and the automatic suspension system. 
Here are descriptions of the three swap types:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Email – All electronic-only swaps fall under this type. Swaps of email letters or surveys, e-cards, blog links, Etsy favorites, Flickr favorites, digital photography, etc. Email swaps are any swaps that are done over the internet and do not require postage.</li>
          <li>Letter – All mail swaps that only require one or two postage stamps, like postcards and simple letters in standard-size envelopes.</li>
          <li>Package – Any swaps that must be mailed in a package. Most swaps will fall under this type. Anything sent in a box, bubble mailer, or large envelope.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Of course, there may be some swaps that are hard to fit perfectly into a type. Two dimensional craft swaps, like hand-made postcards and ATCs, are items which may be hard to fit into one of the three types… Personally, I think handmade postcards that are mailed naked with a postcard stamp should fall in the “Letter” type. ATCs which are mailed with protection in an envelope could go in the package category. There will have to be some level of trust in coordinators to pick the correct type for their swaps. The system cannot be absolutely perfect, but it will help separate simple e-swaps from time and money-intensive package swaps. Iwill be adding the type descriptions to the swap creation page and the Swap-bot FAQ as soon as possible. Also, as swap coordinator, you can edit your past swaps in order to choose a swap type if you would like. Past swaps will receive an “undesignated” type category if they are not edited by their coordinators.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</p>

        <p>Those are all the (intended) changes that were made this weekend. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Like always, we will continue to work to improve Swap-bot!</p>

		<p>We are performing some site maintenance which will cause the Swap-bot site to be down for approximately 30 minutes to an hour at 11 pm (US Eastern Standard Time) tonight. There are a few (minor) new features which will be added at that time. We will write more about the changes tomorrow… Thanks for your patience.</p>

		<p>We have now implemented a universal twenty-swap limit on ALL Swap-bot swappers. You have NOT been dropped from any swaps – even if you are signed up for 100s. You simply cannot sign up for any new swaps until your current list is less than twenty swaps. This may seem quite sudden, but we felt it was necessary to move forward on the swap limit at this time. Remember to use your watchlist to keep track of swaps that fall outside the limit.</p>

<p>All new users start with a five-swap limit. Now, once they receive three “5” ratings, they are moved up to the twenty-swap limit. BUT, the watchlist is always completely UNLIMITED. (Previously the watchlist had a glitch and was being limited to five swaps for new users – we fixed that.)</p>

<p>This universal swap limit may seem harsh, but we have been discussing and receiving feedback on it for what seems like a long time. We believe it is necessary in order to protect good swappers from high levels of swap-lifting by dishonest people. In previous polls on the blog82% of respondents thought there should be some sort of limit&lt;?a&gt; and</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/10/20/swap-limit-poll/">64% of respondents thought that limit should be twenty swaps or less</a>. Obviously not everyone participated in the blog polls and we are still totally open to feedback. However, our main objective is to prevent massive flaking and stealing. We have plans for a tiered system in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Remember to continue to come check out the Swap-bot blog. I have been posting a lot of important information as well as fun stuff like giveaways and crafty links. We do still have plans to start a Swap-bot Wiki, but for now this is the place for lots of good Swap-bot info! I think I will be announcing another great giveaway on Monday or Tuesday, so be sure to check back for that.</p>

<p>There is more info about recent site changes <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/22646">here</a> and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/23112">here</a>. Our changes can get really confusing, but I will always try to keep you as updated as possible.</p>

<p>One more thing: For any adventurous beta testers out there, we have created a Swap-bot chat room! Yes, you read that right, a SWAP-BOT CHAT ROOM! woot! Travis has been working really hard on it. It is not quite ready for a full release, but we really need people to try it out. Everyone is welcome, but please keep in mind that there will definitely still be some bugs to work through… Also, it is a PUBLIC chat room, so be sure to watch yourself accordingly. Ok, if you are brave <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/chat">GO HERE</a> to start chatting! Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>xoxo</p>

		<p>The forums are a great place to chat with friends, ask questions, and learn about Swap-bot, but in the past arguments and disruptive content have made the forums unpleasant for many users. We have now posted some new, straightforward Forum Rules for all of us to follow. They are very similar to rules enforced on other major internet discussion boards and forums. Swap-bot Admins (Rachel &amp; Travis) will be taking a stricter stance on the rules and a more active role in closing threads and restricting forum access for problem users. We stand by our commitment to free speech and non-censorship, while also working to provide a safe and fun discussion environment. A shorter version of the new rules is below, but please read the entire <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums_info.php">Forum Rules</a> page asap!</p>

<p><strong>Forum Rules of Conduct</strong></p>

<p>Violations of the following rules may result in a temporary or indefinite forum ban. Extreme violations may result in a partial or full account suspension. Forum bans and account suspensions can happen with or without warning and are at the discretion of Swap-bot Admins.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hate-speak and disruptive or hostile comments are not allowed.</li>
  <li>Threats of violence (against yourself or others) and personal attacks are not allowed.</li>
  <li>Using the forums as a way to Spam other members or advertise unrelated goods or services is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Posting another person’s address or contact information (including email address) is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Making repetitive or disruptive posts and repetitively “bumping” threads is not allowed.</li>
  <li>The use of false or duplicate accounts (also called “sock puppets”) in the Swap-bot Forums for the purpose of disruption or to avoid detection is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Posting copyrighted content without the permission of the copyright owner is not allowed. This includes posting private messages or email content without the author’s consent.</li>
  <li>Maliciously and/or falsely posting a user in the Questionable Swapper category is not allowed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Forum posts containing the following types of content may be closed by Swap-bot Admins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interpersonal disputes or arguments unrelated to Swap-bot</li>
  <li>Vulgar, obscene, or pornographic text or images</li>
  <li>Repetitive or hostile arguments</li>
  <li>Offensive or disruptive content that upsets other users</li>
  <li>Any type of comment making fun of Crusher, the Swap-bot mascot!</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite our best efforts to make these rules as specific as possible, there are still many gray areas. Our goal is NOT to be the etiquette or profanity police. Swap-bot is an adult site and therefore an appropriate level of adult content and language is fine. All enforcement and interpretation of the forum rules will be done by the Swap-bot Admins at their discretion.</p>

<p>The new rules are not retroactive. We are not going to sift through old posts looking for rule-breakers. Also, because these are new policies, we have removed the previous forum restrictions placed on users. Everyone gets a clean slate. However, new forum bans will be permanent, so do NOT break the rules.</p>

		<p>Two new and fairly major updates today:</p>

<p>(1) <strong>Rating limit on partially suspended users</strong> – Partially suspended users can no longer leave negative ratings. While suspended, the only rating option available for them to give their partners in their swaps is the “5” rating. We have had some trouble with suspended users leaving retaliatory and unfair ratings for their partners. This change prevents that from happening. However, if/when a user makes up their poor ratings and becomes un-suspended, all of the rating options become available once again. It is still up to each individual to determine whether to send to a suspended member based on whether you believe they will fix their poor ratings and become a good swapper again. It is a tricky situation, but this change will at least stop good swappers from being “hurt” by questionable swappers.</p>

<p>(2) <strong>Swaps now closed after six months</strong> – All swaps will now be “closed” six months after their send date. At this time the swap will no longer be editable by the coordinator and participants will no longer be able to view their partners’ address info or rate their partners. This change prevents users’ addresses from being on view indefinitely to their previous swap partners. It also ensures that swappers can put old swaps “behind them” and no longer have to worry about things like if they are going to get a bad rating from a partner they sent to but never heard from.</p>

<p>This is what the swap option box will look like in a closed swap:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-1.png"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-1.png" alt="" title="picture-1" width="456" height="182" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-206" /></a></p>

<p>This change works with our automatic account suspension system (see previous update info <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2007/11/24/automatic-account-suspensions/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2007/12/02/site-updates/">here</a>) to provide a statute of limitations on poor swap performance. Six months after a swap, a swapper can no longer receive a new rating in order to remove a “1” from their account, but their “1” ratings are no longer used as a determining factor in the automatic account suspension at that time. Basically, once a swap is six months old it is closed and your rating (or non-rating) is set in stone. Of course, since this is a new (and abrupt) change, we can work with any coordinators who need any assistance or wiggle room.</p>

<p><strong>A few words about partial and full suspensions:</strong> The computer handles all partial suspension that are based on users having four, or more, “1” ratings. Those suspension happen automatically, so it is important that we all rate honestly and promptly so that the computer can do its job effectively. Swap-bot Admins also partially suspend users for questionable performance or for being underage. Full suspension is only used for a small number of reasons (fraudulent or dangerous behavior, using an account to spam other users, invalid or questionable address, duplicate accounts, or offensive or hurtful behavior). Now that users are able to delete their accounts, full suspension only indicates a breach of our rules or policies. Having a certain number of “1” ratings does not necessarily mean that a user will be fully suspended. We rely heavily on our coordinators to determine who they allow in their swaps. Even if a swapper who has recevied a bunch of “1”s becomes unsuspended after six months, that does NOT mean that coordinators need to (or should) let them in swaps. Coordinators own their swaps. We are not able to reassign partners or remove participants after a coordinator has assigned partners. Please keep this is mind when choosing what swaps to join. A coordinator’s record and the swap’s wording can tell you a lot about how successful a swap is going to be. Also keep in mind that a low level of flaking is a risk we all take when swapping with others over the internet. Yep. Ok.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 10/26/08:</strong> We have made some revisions to the site changes released last weekend. In response to user comments we have made the following adjustments:</p>

<p><strong>Swap Closure:</strong> Swaps will still be closed six months after the mail deadline, but we have changed what it means to be closed. A closed swap can no longer be edited by the coordinator, and all participant address info is removed from view. However, you can still leave or change ratings. Ratings will always be able to be improved and you will always be able to view the Swap-bot username (and click to go to their profile page) of your previous partners.</p>

<p><strong>Rating changes:</strong> Positive ratings now “lock in” after a two-week revision period. Two weeks after rating your partner you can no longer lower a rating. You can only give higher ratings after the two weeks. For example, if you give your partner a 5, you then have two weeks to change that rating if it was a mistake. After two weeks, the 5 is permanent. If you give your partner a 3, you then have two weeks to lower it to a 1 if needed, but you can raise it to a five at any time. If you give a 1 rating it can be changed to a higher rating at any time. However, you must be very careful when revising ratings to a higher level because they will immediately “lock in” if it has been longer than two weeks after you left their very first rating. The “I do not wish to rate at this time” option becomes unavailable two weeks after giving any numbered rating. Comments and hearts will always be revisable or removable, but changing either will NOT affect a rating’s time stamp and will NOT cause the rating to jump to the top of a person’s rating list.</p>

<p>This rating change requires that we are all more careful and deliberate about our ratings. Make sure that you are rating the correct person in each swap. Also, remember to always include the swap name and your username in each swap package so that you partners can easily rate you.</p>

<p>Travis will be releasing these new changes tonight. Important: All current ratings have been given the two week revision time period. If you believe you have rated anyone a 5 mistakenly, now is the time to revise it. Remember, all low rating can be revised to a higher rating at any time – only 5 ratings become totally permanent after the two-week period.</p>

<p>This rating change is confusing, but it should not affect most of us very often. It basically only prevents users from changing positive ratings in a revengeful manner. It ensures that we never have to worry about losing any of the positive ratings that we have earned.</p>
