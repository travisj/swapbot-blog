		<p>Thank you to everyone who participated in our <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2015/10/30/2015-holiday-gift-donation-drive/">2015 Holiday Gift Donation Drive</a> to benefit <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org">The Partnership for the Homeless</a>! <strong>Together we raised $1,050 in cash and gift card donations and collected more than a dozen toy and gift items.</strong> All of the donations were distributed at the Children’s Holiday Party on December 12th, which served more than 250 local NYC kids.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/childrensholidayparty15.jpg" alt="childrensholidayparty15" width="600" height="805" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17339" /></a></p>

<p>Arnold S. Cohen, President &amp; CEO of The Partnership for the Homeless, sent the following message of thanks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I want to thank you for your generous participation in the year’s Annual Children’s Holiday Party. Thanks to you, the party was a huge success with over 250 children and their families enjoying a day of fun at Genesis Home-Help USA, Brooklyn, NY where they enjoyed great food, crafts, games, and gifts. These photos of the party show the joy and excitement you helped create.</p>

  <p>It’s hard to imagine how precious a fun day is to these families. Many have spent months living in homeless shelters, with none of the familiarity and warmth of home. And others are on the brink of falling into homelessness. The Partnership’s staff at our Family Resource Center is working with these families to get them back into an apartment or working to prevent them from falling into homelessness. They also go beyond immediate needs to assist families in securing the best healthcare and education options for themselves and their children, financial counseling and job development.</p>

  <p>All of us at the Partnership thank you Swap-bot for helping our families experience the support of a community, especially as they face the many challenges in their lives. We look forward to partnering together again for next year’s party.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is great to hear that we helped make the party a success!! Thank you all for your donations and enthusiastic support each year. This is a very special community. Happy 2016!! xoxo</p>

<p><strong>October 2015 will be Swap-bot’s 10-year anniversary.</strong> Woah. I am truly astounded. My husband, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj">Travis</a>, and I created this website a decade ago in an effort to make group swapping easier and more fun, and we have worked hard to keep it running ever since. (Check out our very <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/1">first swap</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Over the past 10 years Swap-bot has gained more than 65,000 accounts, facilitated more than 200,000 swaps, and received 280 MILLION pageviews! Wow!</strong></p>

<p>To celebrate our 10-year milestone, I am hosting a <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/206850">Swap-bot-themed 10th Anniversary Mail Art Swap</a>. I’d love for it to be a huge swap. Please join us in sending out fun mail art all over the globe!</p>

<p><em><strong>The swap details:</strong> You will have just one partner to whom you will send one piece of Swap-bot-themed mail art. It can be a postcard, letter, or parcel, but it MUST be decorated externally with a Swap-bot theme. Think blue and orange, postal mail images, Ernie the Envie, swap terms, etc. Put some time into making something that will delight our mail carriers! It is not required, but it’d be fun to include a note or goodies with your mail art for your partner. I’ve made this a very easy and inclusive swap so that everyone will feel comfortable joining and celebrating Swap-bot. New swappers and experienced members with a 4.9 rating, or higher, are welcome to join this international swap. As always, I will check over participants and remove anyone questionable. <strong>Sign up <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/206850">HERE</a> by October 1st!</strong></em></p>

<p>Please take a photo of your mail art creation and email it (or a link to it) to me at rachel -at- swap-bot.com. I’d LOVE to share your artwork here on the Swap-bot blog. Also, check back here for some fun 10th anniversary giveaways very soon!</p>

<p>Swap-bot’s awesomeness comes from our amazing community of swappers. <strong>Thank you all for swapping with us and supporting us for the last ten years!!</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/200000">Come one, come all to Swap-bot’s 200,000th swap!!</a></strong></p>

<p>Wow. Can you believe so many swaps have been hosted on the ‘bot?! Swap-bot has been running for nearly 10 years, but the number still blows me away. (It feels like just yesterday that I hosted the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/100000">100,000th swap</a>.)</p>

<p>In honor of our very first swap, the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/200000">200,000th Swap</a> is an easy, international, Type 2 postcard swap. Nearly everyone — new and experienced users alike — are welcome to join this fun and inclusive snail mail exchange. That being said, there is a 4.8 rating requirement and I will remove questionable participants with any recent 1s or problematic behavior.</p>

<p>For the swap, you simply <strong>send one postcard to each of your two partners</strong>. The postcards are sender’s choice, and can be store bought or handmade. They can be in a Swap-bot theme (and I would LOVE to see photos of you creations!) but they do not have to be. However, <strong>you MUST include a note on your cards describing one of your favorite swap experiences</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/200000">Sign up</a> by May 29th, and send by June 19th. Easy peasy.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/swapbotlovesyou.png" alt="swapbotlovesyou" width="600" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11548" /></p>

<p>If you are reading this, <strong>THANK YOU for making Swap-bot what it is!</strong> We are so thankful to all of our members for hosting so many awesome swaps and making it such a fun and creative community. Here’s to a million more swaps!!! (Hey, it could happen!)</p>

<p>You may have already heard the exciting news… but the Swap-bot team has grown by one member! <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj">Travis</a> and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">I</a> welcomed our baby boy, <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/2015/01/13/introducing/">Kenneth Gunner Johnson</a>, on January 8th, 2015.</p>

<p>Ken is an awesome baby and we have had a wonderful time getting to know him over the last three months. He hasn’t quite gotten the hang of answering Swap-bot help email yet, but hopefully we will get him going on that soon!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/kenswapbot2.jpg" alt="kenswapbot2" width="600" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11533" /></p>

<p>Thanks for all of your kind words and support during this time as we adjust to being a family of three. Swap-bot has always been a family-run website, maintained by just me (Rachel Johnson), my husband, Travis, and of course, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:crusher">Crusher</a>, our sweet pup and loyal site mascot. As long as you all love swapping, we plan to continue running and improving the site to the best of our abilities. Someday, maybe Ken will truly be able to help out!</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/category/kenneth/">read more about Ken on my personal blog</a> and see LOTS more of photos of him in his <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/sets/72157650253413865/">Flickr album</a>.</p>

<p>As if you didn’t already know, Christmas and New Years are approaching very quickly!!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.usps.com/holiday/">USPS</a> published their deadlines for mailing DOMESTIC items to arrive by Christmas Eve on December 24th:</p>

<p>**December 15th (today!) – Standard Post®</p>

<p>December 20th – First-Class Mail® &amp; Priority Mail®</p>

<p>December 23rd – Priority Mail Express®**</p>

<p>Many of the deadlines for international Christmas mail have already passed. Although, you could still try their pricey Global Express Guaranteed service.</p>

<p>The postal services of most other countries offer similar deadlines, but check with your service’s website for their official dates.</p>

<p><strong>Happy holiday mailing!</strong></p>

<p>Did you know? <strong>Nearly 24,000 children will be sleeping in New York municipal shelters tonight.</strong></p>

<p>It is that time of year again when we can help brighten the holiday season for some of NYC’s homeless youth. Help us by donating to our <strong>5th Annual Holiday Gift Donation Drive</strong> to benefit the <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org">Partnership for the Homeless</a>!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/redstripe2.gif" alt="redstripe2" width="600" height="29" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11375" /></p>

<p>The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services, support, and advocacy for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate our donation of new, unwrapped gifts and gift cards to be handed out to children at their <strong><a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/childrens-holiday-party">Children’s Holiday Party</a> in Brooklyn on December 6th, 2014</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Message from The Partnership for the Homeless:</strong> _&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We thank you for your past support and look forward to your continued sponsorship as we put on our annual Holiday Party for these children and their families. The afternoon will be magical for these children with music, games, crafts, face painters, tasty food and a picture with Santa. We hope that this will result in an abundance of laughter. The need for funding remains — we need to defray the costs for items like food, entertainment and transportation for the children and their families.</p>

  <p>We hope to send each child home with toys, games, clothes and books, but more importantly, a smile from ear to ear. These “gifts from Santa” are only possible through donations, toy drives and the generous spirit of contributors like you. As a non-profit, we need people like you to help us make this a special afternoon.</p>

  <p>I hope we can count on your participation once again during these tough times. Thank you for your support and wishing you a happy holiday season filled with warmth, health and happiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Let’s put together a huge donation of gifts for The Partnership!!</strong></p>

<p>We can accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $10 or $20 amounts to stores like Target, Barnes and Noble, H&amp;M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Best Buy. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC. <strong>Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless</strong> because they are versatile and good for older kids, but we can also accept new, unwrapped toys, books, and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations. <a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/sponsorship-opportunities/">Read more info about what can be donated here.</a></p>

<p>Send your donations by Monday, November 24th to:</p>

<p>**Rachel Johnson</p>

<p>Swap-bot.com</p>

<p>285 5th Ave PMB 415</p>

<p>Brooklyn, NY 11215**</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/redstripe2.gif" alt="redstripe2" width="600" height="29" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11375" /></p>

<p>And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: <strong>Each Swap-bot member who sends in a donation of a gift card or item will earn the removal of one low (1 or 3) rating from their account!!</strong> You must mail your donation to Swap-bot headquarters (address above) by <strong>Monday, November 24th</strong>. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will receive a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only earn one rating removal credit during this donation drive –- although you are welcome to donate more than one item!</p>

<p><strong>The Fine Print:</strong> <em>All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings — it is not a “free pass” for flaking. Everyone who donates will receive an email from me with the details of the rating removal credit. You can reply to that message any time to “cash in” your credit. I also make a permanent admin note (only visible to admin) on each donor’s account stating that they have a rating removal credit.</em></p>

<p><strong>International option:</strong> If you are unable to purchase appropriate gift cards in your area or ship other gifts, I am willing to accept cash donations via <a href="https://www.paypal.com">Paypal</a>. I will then buy a gift card in your name to donate OR donate the money directly to the Partnership for the Homeless, depending on their greater need. Use the button below to donate OR send Paypal donations to rachel -at- swap-bot.com. (Replace the -at- and spaces with @.) All Paypal donations of $10 or more will count toward a rating removal.</p>

<p><strong>Use this button to donate via Paypal:</strong></p>

<p>The 2014 Donation Drive is now completed.</p>

<p>As always, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/contact.php">let me know if you have any questions.</a></p>

		<p>Last weekend we made some infrastructure updates and <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2014/06/08/updating-swap-bot-hq-time-zone/">we also switched the site to the UTC time zone</a>. You all (our users) have been SO COOL and helpful regarding the time zone change. Travis and I were extremely impressed with your willingness to roll with the change and we really appreciate all of the feedback.</p>

<p>And your reward? More confusion! Ugh. Sorry. We know this is a little crazy… but…</p>

<p><strong>Today we switched Swap-bot back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone">US Pacific Time</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Swap-bot was originally created in the Pacific time zone (years ago) and in listening to your feedback and concerns about UTC time, we feel that this will be a good solution. Putting the site in Pacific Time will mean that most of the world will be AHEAD of official Swap-bot time. This will give everyone (except for those in Hawaii and Alaska) a little extra leniency and time when signing up for and sending swaps. Unfortunately, it will also mean that our international swappers will have to wait a little longer (according to their local time) to assign swap partners.</p>

<p>The time zone issue is tricky and confusing since each international swap is technically being coordinated simultaneously across the globe. But being in Pacific Time will mean that very, very few swappers will ever have to worry about their swap being marked late (if they send on time in their own time zone). The corner “Swap-bot Time” clock will stay, and we hope to add some info explaining why it may be different than your current time zone.</p>

<p>Thank you again for all of your help and patience. Please continue to keep us posted with any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>When we first announced the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2014/04/02/apply-to-be-a-swap-bot-ambassador/">Swap-bot Ambassador program</a>, we weren’t sure how much interest there would be… but we definitely received more applications than we anticipated! Thank you so much to everyone who applied. It is so thrilling and heart-warming to know that we have so many enthusiastic Swap-bot users!</p>

<p>I wish we could have accepted all of the Ambassador applicants, but since the program is just starting, we had to keep the list manageable. We based our selections on each applicants’s swap history, the age of their Swap-bot account (it had to be at least a year old), rating history, their region need, and their written application.</p>

<p><strong>I am so excited to introduce our very first class of Swap-bot Ambassadors!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Congrats to all of our new Ambassadors!!</strong></p>

<p>Starting tonight, you will see this graphic at the top of each Ambassador’s profile page:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ambassadorgraphicblog.gif" alt="ambassadorgraphicblog" width="600" height="90" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11136" /></p>

<p>Swap-bot Ambassadors are responsible for spreading the word about Swap-bot, distributing Swap-bot swag, and being engaged, friendly, helpful members of the community. In the coming months, we will be introducing each Ambassador individually on the blog. Look for the first introductions starting next week.</p>

<p>Missed the Ambassador application deadline? Didn’t get selected this time around? Never fear, we hope to keep expanding the Ambassador program and will be calling for new applications in the future. Stay tuned!</p>

		<p>Over the weekend we were hard at work making a few improvements to Swap-bot’s hosting infrastructure. With the improvements, we made a few small, but important changes.</p>

<p><strong>First,</strong> we decided to move to UTC (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a>, also know as Greenwich Mean Time) as the official time zone of Swap-bot. Prior to this change, we used EST and EDT, but since we are a community with members all over the world, we needed to use a time zone that all of us could more easily understand. UTC does not spring forward or fall back, it is constant. With this change, we added an official Swap-bot HQ clock to the upper right corner of the page. If you are ever unsure of the time in Swap-bot land, look no further.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-08-at-7.52.58-PM.png"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-08-at-7.52.58-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-06-08 at 7.52.58 PM" width="600" height="85" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11128" /></a></p>

<p>Most of us are a few hours removed from the UTC time zone, which will require some pre-planning and thoughtfulness when swapping. Swap sign ups will still close at midnight on the sign up deadline, but it will now be midnight in the UTC time zone. The same time difference will be true when we are marking swaps as sent. The time difference is not ideal, but using the international mean time is more equitable for everyone on Swap-bot until we can come up with a more sophisticated solution.</p>

<p><strong>Second,</strong> we temporarily removed Chat. It was not heavily used or very useful. We have plans to bring it back better and more engaging than ever in the coming months.</p>

<p>We are going to continue to make small tweaks to the site (and have some big ones planned), so if you see anything not working like you would expect, either leave a comment in <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/category/8">the Help Discussion Forums</a> or contact us through <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/contact.php">the admin contact form</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for you help and patience as we work to improve Swap-bot!</p>

<p>Hello! Due to some much-needed site maintenance, Swap-bot will experience some downtime this Saturday afternoon. The site will most likely not be accessible starting at about 5 pm EST on Saturday, June 7th. It could be down for up to three hours. We are sorry for the inconvenience and we will try to minimize the amount of downtime as much as possible. Please plan accordingly for your swaps and let me know if you have any questions.</p>

I am so excited to tell you that we received more than 50 applications for the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2014/04/02/apply-to-be-a-swap-bot-ambassador/">Swap-bot Ambassador program</a>. Wow! I am so happy to see that there is a big interest in the program. The Swap-bot community is so lucky to have such enthusiastic and caring members!</p>

<p>…BUT…</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot accept all of the applications at this time. (Mostly due to costs. boo.) So, I am doing the hard work of determining who will be in our first class of Ambassadors. I don’t want to rush the process, so check back for the <strong>announcement of the Ambassador roster on Monday, June 9th</strong>. I will be contacting all of the applicants by email before that time to let them know whether or not they have been accepted into the program.</p>

<p>For anyone who is not accepted this round, or for those who may have missed the application process, don’t worry! We hope to continue to grow the Ambassador program. Hopefully, we will be able to accept new Ambassadors each year. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Do you love Swap-bot? Would you like to help spread the word about our awesome, creative community and help attract other fun, crafty, quality members? <strong>We want YOU to be a Swap-bot Ambassador!</strong></p>

<p>Swap-bot Ambassadors will be friendly representatives of the ‘bot in their local region. They will be armed with (free!) Swap-bot swag to distribute as they see fit. Fun! And they will also be strong, visible members of the community online. Each Swap-bot Ambassador will be introduced on the blog and they will have a special designation graphic on their profile page. Additionally, Swap-bot Ambassadors will have the opportunity to publish guests posts on the blog, and they may also be asked for input on future site design and improvements. Sound exciting?!</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Responsibilities:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a Swap-bot account that has been active for a year or longer.</li>
  <li>Be a positive, enthusiastic, active swapper in good standing. (No or very, very few low ratings that can be explained.)</li>
  <li>Be willing to mail and hand out Swap-bot swag.</li>
  <li>Be willing to tell friends (in real life and online via social media) about the fun you have swapping.</li>
  <li>Be open to participating in one-on-one swaps for items from your Ambassador region. (Although, you don’t have to accept ALL one-on-one swap requests.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ambassador Perks:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A big package of fun Swap-bot swag — postcards, pins, mini pencils, stickers, etc — will be mailed directly to you! Send it in your swaps, mail postcards to friends, hand it out around town!</li>
  <li>Included in the swag will be special Ambassador stickers that you can put on your swap packages.</li>
  <li>A special Swap-bot Ambassador graphic will be placed on your profile page indicating your status. (Ambassadorships will be life-long appointments! Unless ambassadors wish to resign or they fall into poor standing.)</li>
  <li>Each Ambassador will be introduced on the Swap-bot blog, with links to their Swap-bot profile page, Twitter, Flickr, blogs, etc.</li>
  <li>Love and gratitude from your Swap-bot Admins!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to Apply:</strong></p>

<p>Send an email to <strong>rachel -at- swap-bot.com</strong> with the subject: <strong>Swap-bot Ambassador Application</strong>. <em>(I don’t want to publish my full email address on the blog as it would attract spammers. Replace -at- with @ to make it a true email address.)</em></p>

<p>Include the following info in your email:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your name and Swap-bot username.</li>
  <li>A photo of yourself that you wouldn’t mind being published on the Swap-bot blog.</li>
  <li>A photo of an excellent swap you sent.</li>
  <li>A description of the region you’d like to represent. It can be a country, state, or city. Depending on the number of applicants, we may adjust each Ambassador’s region.</li>
  <li>How you found Swap-bot, if you can remember!</li>
  <li>Why you enjoy Swap-bot.</li>
  <li>Your favorite type of swap.</li>
  <li>An explanation of any low ratings, if necessary.</li>
  <li>Any links you’d like shared on the Swap-bot blog. Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, blogs, websites, etc…</li>
  <li>An interesting fact or anecdote about yourself. It can be anything!</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that is a lot to include in an email, but you have a LONG time to apply. <strike>Send your application email by May 9th.</strike> <strong>Deadline extended to Friday, May 16th!</strong> Ambassadors will be chosen based on region need, the applicant’s email content, and their swap history. <strong>Ambassadors will be contacted and announced starting in early June.</strong></p>

<p>This should be fun! Let me know if you have any questions.</p>

<p>_The Ambassador program was inspired by our very first Swap-bot Ambassador to Portugal, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mariadastrouxas">mariadastrouxes</a>. Look for her intro in May!</p>

<p>Hurricane Sandy hit our community, New York City, and all of the the East Coast region very hard. People are hurting. Homes and businesses and lives have been lost. We want to help those in need. Want to join us?</p>

<p>For this year’s Swap-bot holiday charity drive, let’s donate to Hurricane Sandy Recovery efforts via the Red Cross. I’ve set up a <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/swapbot4sandy"><strong>Swap-bot 4 Sandy Crowdrise campaign</strong></a>. Financial donations can be made by major credit card and help the Red Cross provide shelter, food, emotional support and other assistance to those affected by disasters like Hurricane Sandy.</p>

<p>Like in our past holiday donation drives, there is an extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: <strong>Each Swap-bot member who donates to our <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/swapbot4sandy/">Crowdrise campaign</a>&lt;/a&gt; (or by one of the alternative donation options below) will get one low (1 or 3) rating removed from their account!!</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/swapbot4sandy/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/donatenow.png" alt="" title="donatenow" width="470" height="58" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9265" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/donatenow-300x37.png 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/donatenow.png 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Alternate donation options:</strong></p>

<p>If you would prefer to donate a gift or winter gear to <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/">The Partnership for the Homeless</a> Children’s Holiday Party, I am accepting those donations, too. We can accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $10 amounts to stores like AMC theaters, Barnes and Noble, H&amp;M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Target. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC. Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless, but we can also accept new toys and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations.</p>

<div style="display: none">

<p>Send your donation to:</p>

<p>**Rachel Johnson</p>

<p>Swap-bot.com</p>

<p>285 5th Ave PMB 415</p>

<p>Brooklyn, NY 11215**</p>

<p><strong>Paypal option:</strong> If you are unable to use a major credit card on Crowdrise and/or cannot purchase appropriate gift donations in your area, I am willing to accept cash donations via <a href="https://www.paypal.com">Paypal</a>. Send Paypal donations to rachel -at- swap-bot.com. All Paypal donations will go toward <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/swapbot4sandy/fundraiser/rachelj">Swap-bot’s Crowdrise campaign for the Red Cross</a> and all Paypal donations of $10 or more will count toward a rating removal.</p>

<p>————</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong> <em>You must donate by <strong>November 30th</strong>. However you chose to donate, you <strong>must include your Swap-bot username with your donation</strong>. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will get a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only get one rating removed during this donation drive – although you are welcome to donate more than one item! (All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings — it is not a “free pass” for flaking.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Swap-bot user, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kiwivandal">kiwivandal</a>, needs your help!</strong> She is teaching a Guerilla Art for Kids workshop at a Youth Town Meeting in her area in April. (The group that puts on Youth Town Meeting is called <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/189732461074329/">The Youth Advisory Council of Caledonia &amp; Southern Essex</a>, in Vermont.)</p>

<p><strong>Kiwivandal wants to collect examples of Artist Trading Cards and mini-zines to give to each of her workshop participants:</strong></p>

<p>_“I would love it if anyone could send a mini-zine or ATC (or both) geared toward 6th to 8th graders. Meaning appropriate themes, public awareness, inspirational. Anything really.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>I am presenting the workshop to 2 groups of 25 kids (50 kids total), my hope is that my wonderful swap-bot community can reach out and help me collect enough zines and ATC’s so that I can give one to each kid to take with them. I have plenty that I have made as examples, but I think it would be so amazing for the kids to see them from other artists and from all over the world.</p>

<p>The conference is the first week of April, so I have 3 months to collect anything I can.”&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>If you’d like to help, you can donate directly to Kiwivandal — her address and additional info is listed in this <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/85814/">forum thread</a> — <strong>or you can join the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/111293">special swap</a> she has set up for the donation drive.</strong> For the swap, you send your ATC or zine to Kiwivandal and then send a photo of what you donated to your swap partner. Your partner will give you a nice rating for donating and you will earn yourself some <strong>Swap-bot swag</strong>! I am sending a big bunch of Swap-bot buttons, stickers, and postcards to Kiwivandal to mail out to everyone who participates in the swap.</p>

<p><strong>Donate an ATC or zine to kids = get Swap-bot swag!</strong></p>

<p>I’ve just learned that this year’s <a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/news/entry/childrens-holiday-party1/">Children’s Holiday Party</a> put on by the Partnership for the Homeless was the biggest ever. The success of the event was in part thanks to the generosity of you, the Swap-bot community. Nearly 500 children attended the event at the Brooklyn Children’s museum and all received gifts — which included the gift cards and winter items that were donated by our site members as part of our <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/12/05/holiday-donation-drive-update/">Winter Gift Donation Drive</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you to all who participated in the donation drive!</strong> Hopefully, we can do something similar next year…</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/10/19/donate-to-the-holiday-gift-drive/">Holiday Donation Drive for the Partnership for the Homeless</a> is now over and I have some amazing totals to report!</p>

<p><strong>The numbers:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>85 Swap-bot members donated something to this Holiday Gift Drive.</li>
  <li>Nearly $600 was donated via Paypal, which I used to purchase 60 Target gift cards for $10 each.</li>
  <li>Over $140 in additional gift cards, to places like Gap, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Old Navy, were mailed in as donations.</li>
  <li>51 items of warm weather gear — like gloves, scarves, sweaters, hats, etc — were donated.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I think this donation drive was an extreme success!!</strong> Thank you so much to everyone who participated. I am taking all of the items to <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5">The Partnership for the Homeless</a> on Wednesday, and they are hosting their <a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/childrens-holiday-party">Children’s Holiday Party</a> on Saturday. I am sure it will be a wonderful event!</p>

<p>There are just a few more days left to participate in our &lt;a href=http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/10/19/donate-to-the-holiday-gift-drive/”&gt;Holiday Gift Drive&lt;/a&gt; for <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5">The Partnership for the Homeless.</a></p>

<p>I can accept gift cards, warm weather gear, toys, and Paypal donations through the end of this week. The gifts and gift cards we collect will be distributed at The Partnership for the Homeless Children’s Holiday Party on December 10th, here in New York City.</p>

<p>For your donation you will receive one rating credit which can be used to remove one low rating from your Swap-bot account. If you don’t have a low rating now, you can hold onto the credit for future use. <strong>But I must have you donation at Swap-bot HQ by this Friday!</strong></p>

<p>Travis (<a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj">travisj</a>) and I are still training hard for the <a href="http://www.marinemarathon.com/">Marine Corps Marathon</a> in Washington DC on October 30th. Only 3.5 weeks until the event! Wow!</p>

<p>We are also still raising money for <a href="http://www.lls.org/">The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</a>…. but only for <strong>one more week</strong>! This is your <strong>last chance</strong> to “purchase” a special Swap-bot swag package by donating to the LLS via our <a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis"><strong>TNT Fundraising page</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I will mail the following pack of items to anyone who donates <strong>$10 or more</strong> via our <a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis">TNT Fundraising page</a> by October 12th:</p>

<ul>

  <li>2 Ernie the Envie square buttons</li>

  <li>2 two-inch square Ernie stickers</li>
  <li>1 two-inch square Swap-bot sticker</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="donate-now"><strong>Donate Now!</strong></h2>

<p>&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>—–</p>

<p>Get cute Swap-bot stuff and support a good cause! Sweet! For more information about where your donation goes and how it is spent, read <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=4123">my post on why I support the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</a>.</p>

<p>—–</p>

<p>The fine print: <em>Your $10 donation covers all shipping costs — even internationally. Of course, we’d certainly welcome any additional donation you’d like to include to off set shipping costs. I will ship to the address listed on your Swap-bot account unless otherwise instructed. If your name or address used for the donation is different than what you have listed on your Swap-bot account, please include your Swap-bot username in the comments field. I feel most comfortable accepting the donations through our <a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis">fundraising page</a>. That way you get an email receipt directly from the LLS that you can use for tax purposes. Your donation is fully tax deductible (in the US – I do not know about other countries). In addition to your email receipt, you will get an email from me confirming that your swag pack is on its way. Contact me at rachel -at- swap-bot.com with any questions or special requests.</em></p>

<p><strong>Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Breaking news:</strong> As of this week, over 100,000 swaps have been hosted on Swap-bot! Wow!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj">Travis</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">I</a> (and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:crusher">Crusher</a>) have been running Swap-bot for almost six years and we never would have thought that so many swaps could have been hosted on our fun, little website. To celebrate this 100,000th swap milestone, I’m hosting a Swap-bot-themed mail swap — <strong><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/100000">the 100,000 Swap!!</a></strong></p>

<p>Everyone is welcome to join this easy swap. Each person will have one partner to whom they will send one piece of Swap-bot-themed snail mail. It can be a postcard, a letter, an ATC, an inchie, anything! The only strict requirement is that your item go through the postal mail and that it has some sort of Swap-bot decoration on it.</p>

<p>Let’s see how many Swap-bot creations we can send all over the world!</p>

<p>You may remember that last year I <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=3570">ran the NYC Marathon with The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society’s Team in Training</a>. As part of my commitment to the Team, I raised funds for cancer research and patient care… and the Swap-bot community helped out! Last year over <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/07/13/support-good-cause-get-swap-bot-swag/">60 packs of Swap-bot swag</a> were mailed out as a thank yous for donations to the LLS.</p>

<p><a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/teamintraining.jpg" alt="" title="teamintraining" width="470" height="341" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8318" /></a></p>

<p>The entire process of training and fundraising was so fun and rewarding that this year Travis is joining me!</p>

<p>Just in case you don’t know, Travis (<a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj">travisj</a>) is my husband and the programming side of the Swap-bot team. He has never run a marathon before. We are both training for the <a href="http://www.marinemarathon.com/">Marine Corps Marathon</a> in Washington DC on October 30th. We are really enjoying the training, so far, and we have set a joint <strong>fundraising goal of $5000</strong> — that is where you come in!!</p>

<p>Many Swap-bot members have requested a way to buy Swap-bot postcards, stickers, and buttons in the past. (We are STILL planning to construct an official store, but the process is slow-going.) BUT, now is your chance to get fun Swap-bot swag!!! You can “purchase” a special Swap-bot swag package by donating to The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society via our <a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis"><strong>TNT Fundraising page</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Get cute Swap-bot stuff and support a good cause! Sweet! For more information about where your donation goes and how it is spent, read <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=4123">my post on why I support the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/swapbotswag2.jpg" alt="" title="swapbotswag2" width="470" height="416" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8320" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/swapbotswag2-300x265.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/swapbotswag2.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>I will mail the following pack of items to anyone who donates <strong>$10 or more</strong> via our <a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis">TNT Fundraising page</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 Ernie the Envie postcards</li>
  <li>3 NEW “Sealed with Love” postcards</li>
  <li>2 “Love Snail Mail” postcards</li>
  <li>2 Ernie the Envie square buttons</li>
  <li>2 Swap-bot 1-inch buttons – 1 of each style</li>
  <li>2 two-inch square Ernie stickers</li>
  <li>1 two-inch square Swap-bot sticker</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="donate-now"><strong>Donate Now!</strong></h2>

<p>&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>—–</p>

<p>The fine print: <em>Your $10 donation covers all shipping costs — even internationally. Of course, we’d certainly welcome any additional donation you’d like to include to off set shipping costs. I will ship to the address listed on your Swap-bot account unless otherwise instructed. If your name or address used for the donation is different than what you have listed on your Swap-bot account, please include your Swap-bot username in the comments field. I feel most comfortable accepting the donations through our <a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis">fundraising page</a>. That way you get an email receipt directly from the LLS that you can use for tax purposes. Your donation is fully tax deductible (in the US – I do not know about other countries). In addition to your email receipt, you will get an email from me confirming that your swag pack is on its way. Contact me at rachel -at- swap-bot.com with any questions or special requests.</em></p>

<p><strong>Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!</strong></p>

<p>As many of you are already aware, the <a href="http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/default.jsf">Canadian postal system</a> is currently shut down due to a strike. That means no mail is going in or out of the country. Operations officially shut down on the 14th. You can get more information about the strike <a href="http://media.infopost.ca/en/archives/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, if the Canadian postal system is not running, swaps cannot be sent to and from that country. Hopefully, the strike will end soon, but for now: <strong>Do not rate your partners down for late mailing caused by the strike.</strong></p>

<p>Communicate with your partners if you’re swapping is affected by the strike and let me know (rachel -at- Swap-bot.com) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Etsy.com is hosting a <a href="http://www.etsy.com/storque/seller-handbook/etsy-success-symposium-11615/">Success Symposium</a> here in Brooklyn on Tuesday, February 8th. The event is a day-long conference at the Etsy headquarters for Etsy sellers that will help them take their small businesses to the next level. There will be workshops and talks led by industry experts, plus food, and a fun, in-person swap hosted by us, Swap-bot, at the end of the day! <a href="http://www.etsy.com/storque/seller-handbook/etsy-success-symposium-11615/">Learn more about the speakers and details here.</a></p>

<p>The sad news is that all of the tickets for the event are <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/66145019/etsy-success-symposium-event">sold out</a>. BUT WAIT! As one of the sponsors of the event, I have <strong>three scholarships</strong> available to give to three Swap-bot members who would like to attend the event. If you are in the New York CIty area (or will be on February 8th) and have an active Etsy store and Swap-bot account, you can apply to win one of the scholarships!</p>

<p>Apply today by sending me the information listed below to <strong>rachel@swap-bot.com</strong>:</p>

<p>**Your full name:</p>

<p>Your email address:</p>

<p>Your Swap-bot username:</p>

<p>Etsy Username:</p>

<p>Link to your Etsy store:</p>

<p>Description of your product line:</p>

<p>Your 2011 goals for your Etsy business:**</p>

<p>Please only apply if you are seriously interested in attending the all-day symposium. All applications must be emailed to me by Thursday, January 27th, at 6 pm EST. I will contact the scholarship winners on Friday. (The Success Symposium scholarships only provide the conference ticket — not any travel expenses.)</p>

<p>If you won’t be in NY for the Symposium, don’t fret. The event will also be broadcasted live on the Etsy site!</p>

<p>Did you know that as of October 2010, there were over 35,000 people–including over 8,000 families and over 14,000 children–in New York City shelters? That is a staggering number and it makes me want to help, if even in a small way…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5">The Partnership for the Homeless</a> is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services and support for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate a donation of hats, scarves, and gloves/mittens this winter.</p>

<p><strong>That is where the fantastic Swap-bot community comes in! Let’s put together a huge donation of warm weather gear for The Partnership!!</strong></p>

<p>And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: <strong>Each Swap-bot member who mails me a donation of one winter item will get one low (1 or 3) rating removed from their account!!</strong> You must mail your donation to Swap-bot headquarters (address below) by January 10th. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will get a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only get one rating removed during this donation drive – although you are welcome to donate more than one item! We have discussed doing a rating removal program like this in the past and now seems like a great time to try it out. The plan is to make this an annual program, so that in theory, each member could get one rating removed each year by donating to the chosen charity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5">The Partnership for the Homeless</a> needs hats, gloves, and scarves for all ages, from infants to adults, and they accept both <strong>new</strong> handmade and <strong>new</strong> store bought items. Send your donation to:</p>

<p>**Rachel Johnson</p>

<p>Swap-bot.com</p>

<p>285 5th Ave PMB 415</p>

<p>Brooklyn, NY 11215**</p>

<p>All donations must be received by January 10th, 2011. As soon as I receive your donation, I will contact you about which rating you would like removed from your account. Be sure to include your username and email address with your donation. I will be delivering our donations to <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5">The Partnership for the Homeless</a> office on January 17th.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions…. Let’s put together a huge donation from Swap-bot!!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> All ratings removed in exchange for a hat, scarf, or glove donation will need to be six months old at the time of removal. That will make it more difficult for future low ratings to be removed through this system, and will give swappers plenty of time to work out situations with their partners. (That being said, I am willing to look at unique situations that may warrant a quicker rating forgiveness – especially for those who have already donated before this change was announced.)</p>

<p>I am sure that there may be a few scenarios in which swappers could still take advantage of this opportunity, but I think that the six month waiting period will discourage nearly everyone from simply choosing not to send a swap. And hopefully, even with the waiting period this rating forgiveness/donation option will help some people escape an unfair low rating that has been hanging around tarnishing their record while helping NYC homeless at the same time.</p>

		<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/64668">Despicable Me Minion Swap</a> has concluded and many amazing Minion photos were submitted. The little Minions traveled all over the world! Everyone who submitted photos of their Minion was entered in a drawing for a big prize pack – a $50 Fandango gift certificate and fun movie merchandise – and a winner has finally been selected! In fact, Universal Pictures loved this swap so much that they decided to give away a second “runner up” prize of movie merchandise, as well!</p>

<p>The big winner is…</p>

<p>Some of you may already know that I (<a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">racheljohnson</a>, your loyal Swap-bot owner, admin, blogger, and all-around, behind-the-scenes gal) am training for the <a href="http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/">New York City Marathon</a> with <a href="http://www.teamintraining.org/">Team in Training</a>. I trained for and ran a marathon with TNT exactly 10 years ago, so this is a special anniversary for me. I love TNT – it is such a supportive and fun organization – and and I am proud to be raising money for <a href="http://www.lls.org/hm_lls">The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</a>. The goal of the LLS is to find a cure for all blood cancers and to support patients and their families while they are fighting the diseases.</p>

<p>While I was brainstorming ways I could fundraise, Swap-bot swag kept popping into my head. Many Swap-bot members have requested a way to buy Swap-bot postcards, stickers, and buttons in the past and the opportunity has not been available while we are still working to construct an official site store. BUT, now is your chance!!! You can “purchase” a special Swap-bot swag package by donating to The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society via my <a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/nyc10/rjohnsochx">TNT Fundraising page</a>. Get cute Swap-bot stuff and support a good cause! Sweet!</p>

<p>I will mail the following pack of items to anyone who donates $5 <strong>or more</strong> via my <a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/nyc10/rjohnsochx">TNT Fundraising page</a>:</p>

<ul>

<p>In celebration of the , a few of us crafty internet peeps decided to pull together and do something to celebrate! Did you know that according to , in the US, we spend $4.2 billion per year on art supplies and many of them are toxic and harmful to the environment. Instead of buying new, let’s pledge to make April a craft destash month! Together, we can have a really big impact on the environment and on our own wallets.</p>

<p>For the entire month of the April, let’s pledge not to buy any new craft materials, tools, or supplies for the <a href="http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2010/03/april-stash-bust/"><strong>April Stash Bust</strong></a>!</p>

<p>Many of us have huge stashes of unused craft supplies with many fun and creative projects just waiting to be born. So, let’s also pledge to make at least one craft project from our stash using only what we have on hand. For motivation and to show how you can use and repurpose what you already have, there will be exciting destash tutorials and ideas all month long from these great craft sites:</p>

<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>And, of course, right here on the Swap-bot blog!</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the great tutorials and eco-friendly link round-ups that you will find this month in conjunction with the April Stash Bust Challenge, there is also an**April Stash Bust craft supply swap</p>

<div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-3336px;">
  
</div>

<div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-3862px;">
  
</div>

<p>&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;! I am hosting the swap to help us all give life back to otherwise lovely craft supplies that are languishing in our stashes due to disuse. The swap is a super-easy way to reduce, reuse, and recycle! Simply sign up by Earth Day, April 22nd, then send your one swap partner a 6 x 9 inch envelope filled with supplies from your stash, like pretty paper scraps, fabric, yarn, ribbon, stickers, embellishments… anything goes!</p>

<p>And, as if that wasn’t enough eco-excitement to encourage you to take the April Stash Bust pledge, Dollar Store Crafts (with help from the sites seen above) will be hosting an <a href="http://dollarstorecrafts.com/stash/"><strong>April Stash Bust Contest</strong></a>! To enter the contest, take the Stash Bust pledge to not buy any new materials, tools, or supplies for the month of April.

Submit your finished project detailing the stash materials you used with a link to your finished project by Earth Day, April 22nd, to .

We also just created a new <a href="https://twitter.com/SwapbotNews">SwapbotNews</a> twitter account. With the new account we can announce fun swap-bot stuff without it getting lost within all of the new swap tweets. I plan to only tweet about once or twice a day with the <a href="https://twitter.com/SwapbotNews">SwapbotNews</a> account, so you can follow without the fear of being bombarded with too many tweets.</p>

<p>I am going to announce a new Swap-bot Giveaway early next week that will utilize Twitter in some way, so get ready by following <a href="https://twitter.com/SwapbotNews">SwapbotNews</a> now!</p>

<p>(Other Twitter fun facts: you can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/rljart">me</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/crusherdog">Crusher</a>, and crafty stuff like <a href="https://twitter.com/etsy">Etsy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CraftCritique">Craft Critique</a>, as well as famous folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/Oprah">Oprah</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MarthaStewart">Martha</a>!

The last two weeks have been a very tough time for Swap-bot as we moved the offices across the country. We had very limited access to the internet while we were traveling and getting settled, which prevented me from doing anything beyond very basic admin duties. Obviously, that was not the original plan, but we did our best with what we had… and now Travis, Crusher, and I are settled in New York City and I am back in action on Swap-bot! Woot! I hope to announce the winners of the most recent Swap-bot swag giveaway later today, so stay tuned. I am also working my way through back-logged email and I thank you for your patience with my response time. My goal is to get totally caught up and become a highly efficient Admin machine by the end of the week! xoxo, Rachel</p>

<p>A reminder for any local Pacific Northwest swappers, this weekend is the Swap-bot Member Appreciation Event!</p>

Remember to bring your ATCs if you would like to trade!</p>

		<p>Happy Valentine’s Day, swap friends! I hope you have a lovely Saturday.</p>

<p>– Remember, you have one week left to enter for the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/01/31/february-giveaway-enter-to-win/">February Giveaway for the Doodlebug scrapbook supplies</a> . The winner will be randomly chosen on Saturday, February 21st.</p>

<p>– For those of you in the US Pacific Northwest, plans for the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/02/01/swap-bot-member-appreciation-event/">Swap-bot Member Appreciation Event</a> are coming along nicely. The event will be held on Sunday, March 1st, from 12 – 3 pm at the Lamb Cottage in Skinner’s Butter Park (&lt;a href=http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=155+High+St+Eugene+OR&amp;fb=1&amp;split=1&amp;gl=us&amp;cid=0,0,7849176457938046652&amp;ei=1teVSZSjEIKOsQP75ZGjBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=image”&gt;101 Cheshire Ave, Eugene, OR 97401&lt;/a&gt;). All area Swap-bot members are invited. The event promises to be a lot of fun. Snacks and drinks will be provided – including cupcakes! There will be a few activities, including an ATC trade, but also plenty of time for socializing and chatting. Plus, we will be giving away lots of amazing door prizes! I am looking forward to it!</p>

		<p>Like many Swap-bot users, I received an outrageous “investment opportunity” message in my Swap-bot inbox on Thursday morning from user, sand208karaka. If you received a message from sand208karaka please know that it is a scam and delete the message. This bogus user was able to spam hundreds of Swap-bot members in a very short time. However, the account was quickly shut down and the user can no longer log into Swap-bot or participate in any way on our site.</p>

<p>We do not allow spam of any type on Swap-bot. I you receive any other messages that you believe are spam, please forward them to me at rachel [at] swap-bot.com.

		<p>We made a change to the partner assignment system last week. The Swap-bot computer no longer automatically assigns partners three days after the sign up deadline. The swap coordinator must manually hit the “assign partners” link in order for the partners to be assigned no matter how long after the sign up deadline it is. We have had many complaints about coordinators who have gone missing before swaps even begin. This new indefinite partner assignment delay will prevent swaps from starting if the coordinator is not actively participating.</p>

<p>The Swap-bot computer still does the random partner assignments, the process just has to be initiated by the coordinator. We are sorry for any confusion.</p>

<div style="display: none">

<p>We are not sure at this point if we are going to continue this change, or go back to the old way of only a three day delay. What do you think?</p>

<p><em>(Also…I am behind on responding to user emails. I did a less-than-stellar job keeping up with them while I was traveling last week. If you sent me something and I have not responded, you should hear from me by the end of today. You can always drop me another note if you are concerned. I should be totally caught up by the end of today.)</em></p>

		<p>Recently there has been a few conflicts regarding the copying of swap ideas and even the copying of swap descriptions word-for-word. We do not support the act of copying swap ideas or wording, however Swap-bot does not have any specific rules against it. We simply cannot police swap copying because it is just way too big of an issue. So many swaps are very similar and it is hard to know where to draw the line.</p>

<p>If you like a swap idea you see on Swap-bot, and you would like to host a similar one, make sure you contact the original swap’s coordinator to ask <em>politely</em> for permission. It is also good etiquette to give credit for the idea to the original swap host and to link back to the original swap within your swap’s description.</p>

<p>If you are a swap coordinator who is worried about your swaps being copied, consider applying a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> copyright to your swap. From the Creative Commons website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Creative Commons provides free tools that let authors, scientists, artists, and educators easily mark their creative work with the freedoms they want it to carry. You can use CC to change your copyright terms from “All Rights Reserved” to “Some Rights Reserved.”</p>

  <p>We’re a nonprofit organization. Everything we do â€” including the software we create â€” is free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can check out the different levels of Creative Commons licenses <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/results-one?q_1=2&amp;q_1=1&amp;field_commercial=n&amp;field_derivatives=sa&amp;field_jurisdiction=us&amp;field_format=&amp;field_worktitle=&amp;field_attribute_to_name=&amp;field_attribute_to_url=&amp;field_sourceurl=&amp;field_morepermissionsurl=&amp;lang=en&amp;language=en&amp;n_questions=3">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can even include the Creative Commons copyright image in your swap description. Because we have disabled the use of HTML, you cannot use the code provided by the CC site, but you can use this Markdown</p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://mdogfood.com/article/blue-dog-food-recall-bf.html">blue dog food recall</a>
</div>

<p>code:</p>

<p>It will look something like this:</p>

<p>Please realize that Creative Commons advocates sharing information and ideas. They define the spectrum of copyright possibilities between full copyright â€” all rights reserved â€” and the public domain â€” no rights reserved. We at Swap-bot also support this idea of collaboration and building on each other’s ideas.</p>

<p>We know that our users spend a lot of time and creativity coming up with their swap ideas and that many take their swaps quite seriously. However, please remember that they are just swaps created for fun and entertainment. Even if you do decide to copyright your swaps through the Creative Commons, it does not mean that there is any recourse that will be taken by the Swap-bot Administration in enforcing the copyright. It is simply a way to make others think before they take ideas.</p>

		<p>You will probably notice in the next little while that we have disabled the ability to color your display names. We have also disabled the ability to use HTML to change the format of your text and profiles. For security reasons we can no longer allow the use of HTML for formatting on the site. Any HTML used in your profile pages, swap pages, or in the forums will no longer work.</p>

<p>I know that everyone was LOVING the name colors, and that many of you had very beautiful and creative profiles. You can still use Markdown to format text on the site. We also hope to have a more systematic way of spiffing up your profile page soon. (With the option for background images and everything!) We will even add in an option for changing the color of your profile name. We just cannot allow the use of HTML at this time. You may have to adjust some of the content on your profile pages. I am sorry for this inconvenience.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/98">this forum post</a> <u style="display:none">[Baby on Board download](http://www.turtlesurvival.org/?baby_on_board)</u></p>

</p>

<p>You can still put some images on your profile if you would like (although too many images may load very slowly and be distracting). Here is the Markdown code for linking to images –</p>

<p>`![image title](URL of image you want to link to)`</p>

<p>It must have the exclamation point first, followed by the image title in brackets, followed by the image link in parenthesis. Good luck!</p>

		<p>User ratings was quietly released today. Rating and commenting on a user’s swap performance works, but the reporting side of things is lacking. Currently the reporting is on a member’s profile page, but I am afraid that page is going to turn into a mess. Any suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>You can get to rating by viewing a swap you are in and clicking on the ‘rate your swap partners’ link under the list of things you can do as a member of the swap.</p>

		<p>I added a bunch of new features to Swap-bot tonight. First, since we were getting so many swaps, I decided swap categories were needed. You can now assign your swap up to three categories and users can search for swaps by category on the View Swaps page.</p>

<p>I also tried to increase usability by clearing up actions that users could preform when they belonged to a swap. To check this feature out, log into Swap-bot and view the details of a swap that you are a member of. (My favorite feature is the photo upload – if it doesn’t work on Windows please let me know).</p>

<p>Finally, I added the ability to make comments about a swap. It is a very basic feature at this point, but as suggestions come in, I can make improvements.</p>

<p>If you find anything wrong with any of these new features, please let me know and I will get them fixed ASAP.</p>

		<p>If you log into Swap-bot you won’t really notice anything different (I hope), but I reworked some of the CSS that is responsible for the positioning of the site. Please check it out and if you notice anything not quite working right, please let me know. I tried to make the site more accessible for swappers with an 800×600 screen resolution (about 12% of pageviews).</p>

<p>I am halfway done with the member profile pages. If you log into Swap-bot, click ‘Manage Account’ and scroll to the bottom of your account information, you will see a revamped info section. Fill out whatever information suits you. Soon (tonight or tomorrow sometime) the first pass at the member pages will be up. Hopefully the member pages will be used by swap partners to learn m</p>

<p>You will be able to get to others’ member pages by clicking on their names in the ‘View Participants’ section under a swap. These pages will be publicly accessible (meaning that you don’t have to be logged in to view them), so you can post the URL to your profile on your blog or anywhere else you want.</p>

		<p>I’ve started a swap-bot development blog a few times before but it never really took off because I didn’t have anything to say. I wasn’t at the stage I am now in development before. I finally have a good foundation built for swap-bot and am now fixing small bugs and releasing new features. This blog will be used to announce and discuss new features and find and resolve bugs… stay tuned.</p>
