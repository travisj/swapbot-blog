<p><a href="http://indiebizchicks.com/wp/">IndieBizChicks.com</a> is a website that provides business, marketing, and publicity information to “women who’d rather work for themselves, than work for the man.” The site was launched in the summer of 2007 by Crissy Herron, a writer, teacher, and speaker with a big passion for entrepreneurship and the DIY movement. She wants to provide helpful information and assistance to people in their 20s and 30s who are looking to become self-employed. If you have a small online business, like an Etsy store or a blog, that you would like to promote, IndiBizChicks.com is a great place to learn about online marketing and business development.</p>

<p><a href="http://indiebizchicks.com/wp/about/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Crissy.jpg" alt="Crissy" title="Crissy" width="160" height="153" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5503" /></a>I met Crissy last weekend, first at the <a href="http://craftyblogging.eventbrite.com/">Etsy Crafty Blogging Panel</a>, and then we spent time hanging out at the <a href="http://www.blogher.com/editorial-blogher10">BlogHer10</a> conference here in New York City. She is very knowledgeable when it comes to just about anything related to running an independent business online and she is a professional and informative speaker. I was impressed!</p>

<p>The Indie Biz Chicks site is a helpful, daily blog and much more! Crissy also creates instructive products, like eBooks and Podcasts, and hosts live e-classes. Some of her products are free and some are available for purchase. For example, Crissy is offering an upcoming, live <a href="http://www.indiebizchicks.com/holiday-marketing-tips.html">Holiday Marketing Tips e-class</a> for just $3. I am also very interested in the collection of <a href="http://www.indiebizchicks.com/summer-biz-sessions.html">Summer Biz Sessions</a> podcasts. For $15 you get the podcast recordings of interviews with some amazing small business owners, like <a href="http://www.aliedwards.com/">Ali Edwards</a> and Jennifer of <a href="http://naughtysecretaryclub.blogspot.com/">Naughty Secretary Club</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you aren’t interested in running your own online business, Indie Biz Chicks is a great place to learn more about online social media and female-owned businesses. Definitely sign up for the free Indie Biz Chicks Newsletter. (Simply enter you email address in the Newsletter form in the upper right hand corner of the site.) Crissy sends out newsletter emails once a week with great biz tips. Today the email contained tips on how to pick the right domain name. Very helpful info if you are just starting out!</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.unanimouscraft.com/">Unanimous Craft</a> is a cool, new website (just launched in March of this year) where you can find hundreds of resources for indie businesses and crafters. The site is a directory and a community that anyone can join. Once you are a member — there is a free and a premium pay option — you can submit your favorite websites and resources or review the current listings.</p>

<p>From the site description:</p>

<p><em>“Unanimous Craft is a tagable, sortable index of resources for crafters, artists and indie business owners. We submit our favorite resources and welcome the community to do the same. Once you become a member, you can submit resources you like, review and rate other resources and curate lists of your favorites.”</em></p>

<p>Unanimous Craft is pretty and easy to navigate. I have been having fun adding some of my favorite resources, like Swap-bot and Craft Critique, and writing a few reviews. If you have been looking for a place to store a directory of your favorite craft websites and resources, I definitely recommend Unanimous Craft.</p>

<p>(p.s. I would be pumped if you would add a review of <a href="http://www.unanimouscraft.com/resources/swap-bot">Swap-bot</a> on Unanimous Craft.)</p>

ChristyNelson.net is a great crafty website and Christy also hosts monthly craft challenges. Myself and two other lucky Swap-botters got to participate in the and we were each sent a package which contained black felt, burlap, safety pins, and black sequins. Each Challenge participant received the same materials and we were each to make any project we could dream up as long as we used at least some of each Challenge item. Check out what I made! It is a 5 x 7″ wallet made with the felt. I used the burlap, rosettes, and sequins as decorative elements, and closed it with a safety pin. I am pleased with how it turned out and how such a random assortments of things can be made into something functional and pretty! Sweet!<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/christychallenge.jpg" alt="christychallenge" title="christychallenge" width="470" height="326" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5229" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/christychallenge-300x208.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/christychallenge.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" />Lisa (Swap-bot user ) also participated in the challenge and she made this amazing .

<p><a href="http://www.christynelson.net/">ChristyNelson.net</a> is an awesome craft blog I discovered during my work with the organizers of the upcoming <a href="http://craftycon.com/">CraftyCon</a> event. Christy is one of the organizers of CraftyCon, one of the co-owners of <a href="http://www.toolulu.com/">Toolulu</a>, a social media marketing company, a mother of two, and she also manages to keep ChristyNelson.net updated constantly with great crafty content. In fact, she has been publishing the blog since December of 2008, posting everything from craft projects and tutorials to product reviews and gift guides.</p>

Christy also hosts ingenious, monthly <a href="http://www.christynelson.net/category/challenges/">Craft Challenges</a>. The Challenges consist of a random group of secret craft supply items chosen by Christy each month. Participants sign up to receive a packet of these craft supplies in the mail for just $5. (They can be purchased in <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/christynelson">Christy’s Etsy store</a>.) When they receive the supplies, they make something awesome, submit photos of their creations, and compete for the chance to win prizes! Each month the supplies are totally different and you don’t know what they will be until they arrive at your door. The Challenges are a great motivator (or excuse) to get you crafting and trying new things. Christy provides the challenge, you provide the inspiration and crafting skill!</p>

<p>This month, I received one of Christy’s Challenge packages. It consisted of some black felt, burlap, black sequins, safety pins, and my favorite, a black chiffon rose. I am already cooking up some great ideas for what I am going to make… check back at the end of the month to see my final craft creation.</p>

It is called and it allows you “give any digital photo the classic look and feel of a vintage or Polaroid picture.” It is a super-simple site to use (you do not have to create an account, which is a huge relief – no need to enter all of your contact info again, like on most other sites) and it offers a bunch of funky effects that you can use on your own photos. I created the two images below using two different Polaroid styles on the site.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/rollipimages.jpg" alt="rollipimages" title="rollipimages" width="470" height="305" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2579" /></p>

<p>is a really quick and easy way to jazz up your so-so digital images or give any photo a vintage feel – give it a try!</p>

		<p>** We use recycled materials to utilize the wealth of existing materials, cutting back on use of new materials and natural resources. Plus we never know what kind of colors or patterns we will find. Using recycled materials ensures that each bag will be funky and unique!<strong>Why Free?</strong>Our bags are free so no one is excluded from actively participating in this simple lifestyle change. We want our bags to be a truly positive experience that will create dialogue and instill environmentally conscious thought while cutting back on plastic bag usage. Furthermore, for us, it is about our environment and making positive change, not making money.”&lt;/i&gt;The group hosts bag making events around New York City for all ages, including school children and the elderly. They also give out their free bags at green markets around the city. Anyone can write to <a href="http://www.bagsforthepeople.org/getbags.htm">Bags for the People</a> (and send a a self addressed and stamped envelope) and they will send you a free bag! Or, you can download their <a href="http://www.bagsforthepeople.org/files/how_to.pdf">free tutorial for making a bag out of an old t-shirt</a>. There is a lot more information about the organization on their <a href="http://www.bagsforthepeople.org/">website</a>, and I think you should check it out! If you get inspired by Bags for the People’s mission, you can also <a href="http://www.bagsforthepeople.org/donate.htm">donate</a> fabric and/or equipment to the cause. What an easy way to make the world a little more green!</p>

<p><a href="http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/">Jinjerup</a> is the adorable online home for the designs, patterns, and illustraions of Chan Lynn, a professional designer. Lynn posts her new patterns nearly daily with short and cute explanations for how she came up with the ideas.</p>

<p>This little snippet from the <a href="http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/search/label/about">Jinjerup about page</a> will give you a feel for Lynn’s sweet personality:</p>

<p><em>“I am constantly amazed by the small wonders of nature, science and the pleasure of the little things in life. They are unbelievably great sources of inspiration for anything. Seeing a well crafted typographic piece, acquiring a beautifully printed new publication are small yet just as meaningful notions which make my heart swell with design joy. What really takes the cake, is of course, coming up with designs to call your own.”</em></p>

<p>The best part of Jinjerup is that Lynn gives away a new, <a href="http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/search/label/freebies">free download</a> every week!! This week you can download adorable <a href="http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/2009/06/freebie-of-week-caterpillar-express.html">Caterpillar Express labels</a>.</p>

<p>You can also purchase items, like t-shirts and mugs, with Jinjerup designs from the <a href="http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/search/label/shop%20news">Jinjerup Store</a>. Lynn also has a personal blog, <a href="http://brikbrac.blogspot.com/">Bric.A.Brac</a>, and a <a href="http://twitter.com/jinjerup">Twitter account</a>.

<p>I know that many of you not only create handmade items to swap, but you also sell them (or want to sell them) on sites like <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> and <a href="http://www.artfire.com/">ArtFire</a>. If you need help navigating the world of selling handmade goods online, <a href="http://www.handmadeology.biz/home/">Handmadeology</a> is helpful resource you should check out. From the site’s description:</p>

<p><em>Handmadeology exists for the purpose of teaching artists how to successfully sell their handmade goods online. Through articles, blogs, video and screen shot tutorials, and Q &amp; A dialogue between Timothy Adam and followers of his work, the formula for selling handmade goods online can be learned.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://timothyadamdesigns.com/">Timothy</a> has had success selling on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5074716">Etsy</a> since 2007 and also has a <a href="http://timothyadamdesigns.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and an <a href="http://www.artfire.com/users/timothyadamdesigns">Artfire store</a> . Selling his handmade metal jewelry, sculpture, and furniture online is his full-time job. On Handmadeology he shares his secrets for success. There are both articles and videos that can help beginners navigate the world of online selling, and help established sellers get more traffic to their store. You can learn more about Timothy and Handmadeology from his <a href="http://www.craftcast.com/main/?p=433">CraftCast interview</a>. &lt;/div&gt;</p>

From the site description: “Craftness.com is a craft challenge site, every week a fresh challenge will be presented. Our community rate crafts and choose the winning artists and designers. We welcome you to join our challenge and craft using your weapon of choice: Ceramic, Needlecraft, Knitting, Jewelry, Fashion or Crochet using Metal Glass or Wood, all crafts are welcome.”</p>

<p>From what I can determine, there is a new craft challenge presented on <a href="http://www.craftness.com/">Craftness</a> every week. Crafters of all types are invited to enter the challenge contest with their completed craft projects. Then, the site users vote on the winners. The winning projects are featured on the site’s front page and there are prizes! This week’s challenge is “Homage to the 70s” and the winner receives $100 from <a href="http://www.misterart.com/greeting_cj.cfm?affiliate.cfm?ap=cj,6,1:4&amp;AID=42551&amp;PID=3228816">MisterArt</a>. I have not tried uploading a project, so I am not entirely clear on how the process works. There is also very limited information on the site, so it is hard to determine how often it is updated… Has anyone else tried out <a href="http://www.craftness.com/">Craftness</a>?</p>

<p><em>“Cafe Handmade is like a traditional craft show, but better. You can now attend a craft show at your leisure, as often as you would like, and have the same experience as a traditional craft show with featured artist interviews, artist demonstrations, giveaways, and more.”</em></p>

<p>There are a lot of craft websites out in the vast internet universe – more than most folks can keep up with – which is why a “one-stop shop” site like <a href="http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/">Cafe Handmade</a> is so handy and fun! <a href="http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2008/11/about-us.html">Cafe Handmade</a> was created in November of 2008 by husband and wife team, Len and Kerri Testa. Their original goal was to create “a place where crafters and artists could show off their creations” and to promote buying handmade.</p>

<p>Cafe Handmade is more than just “a weekly virtual craft show.” There are also feature articles with interviews from <a href="http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2009/04/featured-artist-mari-forssell-stash.html">artists</a> and <a href="http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2009/04/mommaprenuer-audrey-hussey-kaboogie.html">mommaprenuers</a>, <a href="http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2009/04/giveaway-sponsored-by-arys-naturals.html">weekly giveaways</a>, <a href="http://cafehandmade.ning.com/">the Lounge</a> (a social network just for handmade aficionados), artist demos, and a <a href="http://cafehandmade.bluefuzzyslippers.com/">marketplace</a> where you can purchase handmade goods. The <a href="http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2009/03/virtual-craft-show-aisle-1.html">Virtual Craft Show</a> displays the work of dozens of artists and crafters with lots of lovely photos of their products. The wares range from jewelry and clothing to bakery treats and bath items. The <a href="http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2009/03/virtual-craft-show-aisle-1.html">Cafe Handmade craft show</a> is a great place to find new-to-you artists and unique handmade products.</p>

<p><a href="http://thecraftsdept.com/">The Crafts Dept.</a> is a new blog from the Martha Stewart Empire. It was just started on February 27th with intentions of being a meeting place for all of the crafters working for the many Martha Stewart media outlets, like the television show, Living magazine, and the Martha Stewart craft supplies brand. There is not much content at this point, but the contributors plan on sharing official Martha Stewart projects as well as their own personal crafty endeavors.</p>

<p>From the blog’s introduction: “Welcome to the Crafts Department blog. We thought a blog would be a great way to share even more about the crafts we create for Martha Stewart Living as well as what we craft on our own. We hope to provide you with a peek behind the scenes to some of our stories, our inspiration, our favorite sources, as well as some of the projects we are personally working on. Periodically crafters from our television show and from the Martha Stewart Crafts line will also post entries to let us know what is happening in their areas as well. We hope you enjoy it.”</p>

<p>I find some of the Martha Stewart crafters to be a little too hardcore and strict for my taste (they are always talking about how clean and organized you should keep your craft room – phooey!), but I think <a href="http://thecraftsdept.com/">The Crafts Dept.</a> will be a good resource with great photo galleries at the very least.</p>

<p>The news just broke today that <a href="http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2009/02/craft_volume_10_is_our_last_is.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954">Craft: magazine will no longer be printed</a>. <a href="http://craftzine.com/10/">Issue 10</a> is their last printed issue, and they will focus entirely on the <a href="http://www.craftzine.com/">Craftzine.com</a> website going forward. I am a little sad because I have subscribed to Craft: magazine since its beginning and I always secretly wished I had been the person who created it. However, I think moving exclusively to the web is very smart and perfectly in line with the indie craft community.</p>

<p>In the past the Craft: blog mostly re-posted tons and tons of craft stories from around the web (including a little Swap-bot press <a href="http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2006/11/holiday_swaps.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2007/01/magic_yarn_ball_swap_on_swapbo.html">here</a>). It was difficult to keep up with it all and it reinforced the craft-o-sphere internet echo chamber. With the print magazine’s closure, Craft has the opportunity to improve their web presence, and they plan to do just that. Senior editor, Natalie Zee Drieu, and her team plan to publish more, higher quality, original tutorials and articles on the website – bringing the magazine content and style to the internet. I am excited to see how the Craftzine.com evolves! I think it will become an even greater resource for indie crafters.</p>

<p>(You can read more thoughts and info about Craft: magazine’s closure on <a href="http://www.craftypod.com/2009/02/11/craft-and-transition/">CraftyPod</a> and <a href="http://www.designspongeonline.com/2009/02/craft-magazine-closing.html">Design*Sponge</a>.)</p>

It is basically a bookmarking site, like <a href="http://delicious.com/">delicious</a> or <a href="http://digg.com/">digg</a>, but just for images. You create an imgfave account and then you can easily add any images you find on the web to your imgfave library with a handy web browser button. imgfave links to your favorite images and displays them in a clean and clear way. From the site description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>imgfave is an image bookmarking service that allows you to save all your favorite images from around the web in one convenient place. You can also subscribe to users you like to keep up to date on what they’re adding.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think of it as something like a scrapbook or inspiration organizer. It is totally easy to use and although I just started using it, I think it will help me remember and keep track of the many beautiful things I come across on the internet each day. Check out my <a href="http://imgfave.com/index.php?action=showstream&amp;nickname=racheljohnson">imgfave profile</a> to see a few of my favorite images!</p>

<p>From the website: “<a href="http://www.americancraftguide.com/index.html">American Craft Guide</a> is the complete resource for America’s professional handcrafters and artisans, independent artists, craft hobbyists, and those who love to buy American handcrafted goods. We bring all of these groups together to create a community that fosters learning, sharing, and promoting America’s handcrafters and artisans.”</p>

<p>I stumbled on this fairly new (started in July 2008) website today and was really impressed by the site’s clean layout and its goal of creating a comprehensive arts and craft resource. The site includes a collection of <a href="http://www.americancraftguide.com/projects.html">DIY tutorials</a>, a community section where you can chat with other crafters, an <a href="http://www.americancraftguide.com/events.html">arts and craft events calendar</a>, a <a href="http://www.americancraftguide.com/magazine.html">magazine</a> (I think that is their word for blog), and soon there will be a <a href="http://www.americancraftguide.com/directory.html">directory of handcrafters and indie artists</a>. It is still a new site and the community only has about 350 members, but it has the potential to be a great resource!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.postcrossing.com/">Postcrossing</a> is a postal mail hobby website somewhat like Swap-bot. The tagline for the site is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“send a postcard and receive one back from a random person somewhere in the world!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you create an account on Postcrossing you are assigned a random person from around the world to whom you send a postcard. Once you have sent, you are entered in the system to receive a postcard from a totally different random person from anywhere in the world. The system is highly organized and structured with each postcard receiving an identification number and being registered by its recipient. Postcrossing members have sent and registered over 1.5 million postcards! Amazing! There are people from <a href="http://www.postcrossing.com/explore/countries">almost every country</a> using Postcrossing and the site is available in variety of different languages. The Postcrossing website is clear, simple, and easy to navigate with nice features, like a real-time postcard update feed on the main page. There is also a <a href="http://www.postcrossing.com/blog">blog</a> and <a href="http://forum.postcrossing.com/">forum</a>.</p>

<p>We definitely don’t want to lose any of our great Swap-bot postcard swappers to Postcrossing, but I don’t think it is possible to have too many fun options for receiving snail mail from around the world!</p>

		<p>We all know about the online auction giant <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>, and almost everyone is loving <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> for buying and selling handmade goods online, but what if you want an alternative option for finding cool, independent artists and crafters or selling your own crafts? I have discovered three more websites where you can buy or sell handmade items: <a href="http://www.lov.li./">Lov.li</a>, <a href="http://en.dawanda.com/">DaWanda</a>, and <a href="http://www.madeit.com.au/">Made It</a>.</p>

<p>—–</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lov.li./"><img src="http://www.rljart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/lovli.jpg" alt="" title="lovli" width="450" height="408" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1474" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Lov.li</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.lov.li./">Lov.li</a> is a community of people who love art, crafts and handmade products. On the site you can buy cool stuff, share your art, sell your products, create groups, promote events, share video, and of course, make friends. People from all over the world use the site to sell their handmade crafts and to interact with other artists and crafters. You can create your own blog on the site and join groups based around specific crafting interests. Jewelry and accessories seem to be the most popular items being sold on Lov.li, but there is a wide variety of items to explore. Although the site seems somewhat simple, there are many interesting ways to search for products, including by maker, tag, and by those being made closest to your own location.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.dawanda.com/"><img src="http://www.rljart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/dawanda.jpg" alt="" title="dawanda" width="450" height="368" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1476" /></a></p>

<p><strong>DaWanda: Products with Love</strong></p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://freecigs.biz/" title="buy cigarettes online">buy cigarettes online</a>
</div>

<p>From the <a href="http://en.dawanda.com/">DaWanda</a> site: “DaWanda is about people and their products: it is a place where you can discover original and quality products as well as the people who have a passion to create and to share their creations and where you can contribute by sharing your ideas and what you like and by giving inspiration.” DaWanda is based in Europe and the site can be viewed in English, French, or German. Independent artists and craft people sell truly awesome fashions, home products, and supplies on the site. The products being sold on DaWands seem to have an especially high level of quality and uniqueness and the site seems clear and easy to navigate. The site also includes discussion forums in all three languages that anyone can participate in, even if you are not selling or buying.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.madeit.com.au/"><img src="http://www.rljart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/madeit.jpg" alt="" title="madeit" width="450" height="415" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1477" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Made It: buy, sell, and talk independent</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.madeit.com.au/">Made It</a> is an Australian shop and directory of independent designers. Selling is restricted to Australian residents, but buyers from overseas are welcomed. Everything from stationery to bath and body products to clothing is sold on Made It. Made It also has discussion forums, but the highlight of the site is the comprehensive <a href="http://www.madeit.com.au/directory/directory.html">independent Australian designer directory</a> which profiles hundreds of indie businesses.</p>
