<p><strong>October 2015 will be Swap-bot’s 10-year anniversary.</strong> Woah. I am truly astounded. My husband, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj">Travis</a>, and I created this website a decade ago in an effort to make group swapping easier and more fun, and we have worked hard to keep it running ever since. (Check out our very <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/1">first swap</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Over the past 10 years Swap-bot has gained more than 65,000 accounts, facilitated more than 200,000 swaps, and received 280 MILLION pageviews! Wow!</strong></p>

<p>To celebrate our 10-year milestone, I am hosting a <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/206850">Swap-bot-themed 10th Anniversary Mail Art Swap</a>. I’d love for it to be a huge swap. Please join us in sending out fun mail art all over the globe!</p>

<p><em><strong>The swap details:</strong> You will have just one partner to whom you will send one piece of Swap-bot-themed mail art. It can be a postcard, letter, or parcel, but it MUST be decorated externally with a Swap-bot theme. Think blue and orange, postal mail images, Ernie the Envie, swap terms, etc. Put some time into making something that will delight our mail carriers! It is not required, but it’d be fun to include a note or goodies with your mail art for your partner. I’ve made this a very easy and inclusive swap so that everyone will feel comfortable joining and celebrating Swap-bot. New swappers and experienced members with a 4.9 rating, or higher, are welcome to join this international swap. As always, I will check over participants and remove anyone questionable. <strong>Sign up <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/206850">HERE</a> by October 1st!</strong></em></p>

<p>Please take a photo of your mail art creation and email it (or a link to it) to me at rachel -at- swap-bot.com. I’d LOVE to share your artwork here on the Swap-bot blog. Also, check back here for some fun 10th anniversary giveaways very soon!</p>

<p>Swap-bot’s awesomeness comes from our amazing community of swappers. <strong>Thank you all for swapping with us and supporting us for the last ten years!!</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/200000">Come one, come all to Swap-bot’s 200,000th swap!!</a></strong></p>

<p>Wow. Can you believe so many swaps have been hosted on the ‘bot?! Swap-bot has been running for nearly 10 years, but the number still blows me away. (It feels like just yesterday that I hosted the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/100000">100,000th swap</a>.)</p>

<p>In honor of our very first swap, the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/200000">200,000th Swap</a> is an easy, international, Type 2 postcard swap. Nearly everyone — new and experienced users alike — are welcome to join this fun and inclusive snail mail exchange. That being said, there is a 4.8 rating requirement and I will remove questionable participants with any recent 1s or problematic behavior.</p>

<p>For the swap, you simply <strong>send one postcard to each of your two partners</strong>. The postcards are sender’s choice, and can be store bought or handmade. They can be in a Swap-bot theme (and I would LOVE to see photos of you creations!) but they do not have to be. However, <strong>you MUST include a note on your cards describing one of your favorite swap experiences</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/200000">Sign up</a> by May 29th, and send by June 19th. Easy peasy.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/swapbotlovesyou.png" alt="swapbotlovesyou" width="600" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11548" /></p>

<p>If you are reading this, <strong>THANK YOU for making Swap-bot what it is!</strong> We are so thankful to all of our members for hosting so many awesome swaps and making it such a fun and creative community. Here’s to a million more swaps!!! (Hey, it could happen!)</p>

		<p><em>Yes, I am featuring my OWN swap once again… a little self-centered, but I hope I can be forgiven.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/171370"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/postcardBLOG.jpg" alt="postcardBLOG" width="600" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10970" /></a></p>

<p>My goal for this <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/171370">Easy Postcard Swap</a> is to get new users involved and more knowledgeable about the Swap-bot process. <strong>This international postcard swap is open to all new and experienced Swap-bot members!</strong> It is just about the easiest mail swap you can try. Simply send one naked (i.e. addressed, stamped, and NOT in an envelope) to one partner. You will then receive a postcard from another participant in the swap. Easy and fun!</p>

<p>You can send any type of postcard that you’d like. The swap is <strong>sender’s choice</strong> (meaning you don’t have to cater to your partner’s profile) and store bought or handmade postcards are allowed. Write a nice note to your partner, address the postcard, put on some postage, and drop it in the mail! No sweat.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/171370">Sign up now!</a> Let’s make this a huge swap!</p>

<p>Just for fun: <strong>What is your favorite type of postcard to receive?</strong></p>

<p><em>p.s. I DO angel my swaps. Two weeks after the send deadline, if you have NOT received and you HAVE rated your partner honestly with a 1, you can contact me and I will send out an angel postcard.</em></p>

<p>You already know I am a crazy lady when it comes to Valentine’s Day! I just can’t help it. I love all things pink &amp; red &amp; glittery &amp; lovey dovey. I know not everyone feels the same way …which is why this week’s featured swap encompasses a bit more than just the holiday of love.</p>

<p>Even if you aren’t a huge Valentine fan, come join my <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/166461"><strong>February Love Matchbox Swap</strong></a>!! Your matchbox does not necessarily have to be Valentine’s Day related. It can be of any February theme, like winter, President’s Day, MLK Jr Day, my birthday!! haha! The swap is totally sender’s choice, so you can get started on your February crafting now. (You can download a free, printable matchbox template <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/rachels-matchbox-template/">HERE</a>.)</p>

<p>This is the sixth edition of this <strong>international</strong> paper crafting swap and I hope we can get a huge group of participants. For the swap, you simply decorate and fill <strong>one</strong> matchbox for <strong>one</strong> partner and get it in the mail by February 7th. New members and experienced members with a 4.9 rating, or higher, are welcome to join. But I will be weeding out anyone questionable. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/166461">Sign up by January 27th!</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/8432207347/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/matchboxes.jpg" alt="matchboxes" width="600" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10920" /></a></p>

<p>p.s. You can see lots more examples of matchboxes in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/sets/72157602135475903/">Swap-bot set on Flickr</a>. Enjoy!!</p>

<p>I always join a few matchbox swaps during the holiday season. The little, decorated boxes are like fun mini holiday gifts to make and receive!</p>

<p>This year, I am signed up for <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KarlaKC">KarlaKC’s</a> <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/163049#comment-570232">Christmas/Holiday in a Matchbox Swap</a>. For the swap, you make at least one holiday-themed matchbox for your partner. You can use <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/rachels-matchbox-template/">my free template</a> to make your boxes, or simply decorate a real matchbox. Feel free get creative! Some crafters make a set of matchbox drawers by wrapping a few matchboxes together in a stack. You can fill your matchbox with goodies or create a shrine or diorama inside.</p>

<p>Check out some examples <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=christmas%20matchboxes">here</a>.</p>

<p>Autumn has arrived (in the Northern Hemisphere, anyway) and that means falling leaves, Halloween, and Thanksgiving are all on their way. In celebration of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, Swap-bot member <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TC">TC</a> is hosting an <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/160091">Attitude of Gratitude Swap</a>.</p>

<p>I love the idea of the swap: “to get us thinking about all the things for which we should be grateful.”</p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://best-paper-writing-services.com/" title="writing paper">writing paper</a>
</div>

<p>For the Type 2 swap, you send your <strong>one partner</strong> two items, a <strong>letter</strong> and a <strong>flat surprise</strong>. The letter must describe three things you are thankful for: a person, a place, and a thing. A simple concept, but one that can help us focus on the good things in life and our gratitude for them.</p>

<p>New and experienced USA participants are welcome to join the swap, but problem swappers will be removed. A filled out profile is required. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/160091">Sign up before October 23rd!</a></p>

<p>I love contemporary art, so I’m excited for the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/153757">Contemporary Art Postcard Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KSENiA">KSENiA</a>.</p>

<p>Contemporary art can have a broad definition. It can include any art from the current time period or lifetime. Sometimes “contemporary” is defined as any art made after 1970, sometimes it designates art made post-2000, other times it refers to art made after the Postmodern period.</p>

<p>Major contemporary museums include the <a href="http://whitney.org">Whitney Museum</a>, <a href="http://momaps1.org">MOMA PS1</a>, the <a href="http://www.newmuseum.org">New Museum</a>, and my personal fave, the <a href="http://www.kemperart.org">Kemper Museum</a>.</p>

<p>For the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/153757">Contemporary Art Postcard Swap</a>, you can send a postcard with an image of a Modern or Contemporary work of art. The art pictured on the postcard can be of any media: painting, drawing, graffiti, illustration, sculpture, collage, etc.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite contemporary artists include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Diebenkorn">Richard Diebenkorn</a> (his painting <em>Ocean Park #125</em> from the Whitney Museum is seen above), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiebaud">Wayne Thiebaud</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kehinde_Wiley">Kehinde Wiley</a>, <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/mickalene_thomas/">Mickalene Thomas</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Richter">Gerhard Richter</a>. But most likely, I will mail a postcard of one of my very favorite contemporary art series of all time, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=970364">The Quilts of Gee’s Bend</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What contemporary art postcard will you send?</strong></p>

<p><em>Sign up for this international swap by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/153757">July 28th</a>. Send by August 8th. New users with a full profile and experienced swappers with a 4.98 rating are welcome to join. Happy swapping!</em></p>

The butterflies will eventually comprise a breath-taking exhibition, currently scheduled for Spring 2014, for all to remember. The Museum has already collected an estimated 900,000 butterflies, but they need more!To contribute to this moving project and exhibit, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TerryF">TerryF</a> is hosting her second <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/118253"><strong>Holocaust Museum Butterfly Project Swap</strong></a>. All Swap-bot users are welcome to join and send as many butterflies as they would like to the co-organizer, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Leashah">Leashah</a>. To complete the swap, you will also send a postal mail letter to your assigned partner in the swap describing the butterfly you made for the Holocaust Museum and your feelings about the project. The handcrafted butterflies made for this project need to meet a few requirements:   * Butterflies should be no larger than 8 inches by 10 inches.   * Butterflies may be of any medium the artist chooses, but two-dimensional submissions are preferred.  * Glitter and all glitter-related products should not be used.  * Food products (cereal, macaroni, candy, marshmallows or other perishables) also should not be used.Leashah will be photographing the butterflies she receives and posting them on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ourbutterflyproject/">Flickr here</a>. (The butterflies seen above are ones I made for the previous <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/40139">Butterfly Project Swap</a> in 2009.)Let’s make this a huge swap and send a giant box of butterflies to the <a href="http://www.hmh.org/ed_butterfly1.shtml">Holocaust Museum Houston</a>!!————</p>

<p>It went away I’m sure</p>

<p>because it wished</p>

<p>to kiss the world good-bye.</p>

<p>For seven weeks I’ve lived in here,</p>

<p>Penned up inside this ghetto.</p>

<p>But I have found what I love here.</p>

<p>And the white chestnut branches in the court.</p>

<p>Only I never saw another butterfly.</p>

<p>That butterfly was the last one.</p>

<p>I want to share a very creative swap for all of us who love postal mail and stamps. It is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/113050">Inspired by Postage Stamps Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MichelleWillow">MichelleWillow</a> in which you make a booklet all about stamps for your partner. (Above is a stamp from MichelleWillow’s collection.)</p>

<p><strong>From the swap description:</strong></p>

<p>_For this swap you’ll have 1 partner and make for them one little green (recycled) booklet with things you learned through the postage stamps!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Select 10 postage stamps from ANY country except your own and your partner’s (used is preferred!!!), look up for the story behind the image on the stamp and write it down in your booklet.</p>

<p><strong>Rules for making booklets:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>booklet should be at least 6 ” x 4″</li>
  <li>booklet has to be handmade and 100% made of recycled materials (you can use for covers: greeting cards, thin cardboard from cereal boxes, etc. / for pages: old book pages, magazine pages, junk mail, leaflets, etc. / for writing: hand written, hand drawn or clips from magazines or books)</li>
  <li>it’s strictly forbidden to use computer to print out images / text!!! No stickers! (unless they are recycled from envelopes and such)</li>
  <li>try to keep story behind each stamp on separate page and don’t forget to glue a stamp along with a story!</li>
</ul>

<p>&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>For information on how to create the booklets, check out <a href="http://gomakesomething.com/ht/decos/stick-bindings/">this tutorial</a> or <a href="http://gomakesomething.com/ht/decos/basic-deco/">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Experienced craft swappers with over a 4.9 rating are welcome to join this <strong>international</strong> swap. Sign up by March 1st!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/113050">Inspired by Postage Stamps Swap</a> is the third in MichelleWillow’s series of booklet swaps. She has the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/113054">4th edition coming up in April for Earth Day</a>!</p>

<p>I know that not everyone loves Valentine’s Day — it can be too romantic, too gooey and sweet, too commercial — but I think it is a fun theme to craft around. Hearts are a universal motif that can mean many things. And so, this week I am featuring the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/109982">Give a Piece of Your Heart Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KarlaKC">KarlaKC</a>.</p>

<p>For the <strong>international</strong> swap, you simply: “Create something for your partner that is a heart or that has a heart in it.” The heart item can be made with any medium and in any style.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<p><em>“As a crocheter and knitter, I might make a heart stuffie, a bookmark, a necklace, a purse, a scarf…anything that is or has a heart. If you enjoy sewing, you might make any of the above or have other ideas. Beaders, or jewelry makers, what would you make? Papercrafters, there are notecards, ATCs, journals, matchboxes, etc. that you might consider. Woodcrafters, what would you make? Everyone, what can you make that is or has a heart?”</em></p>

<p>Last year, I made the yarn-wrapped heart seen above for a very similar swap. And look at the amazing <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/5435809223/in/set-72157602135475903">embroidered fabric heart</a> that I received from <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:beckarahn">beckarahn</a>! Wow! There are endless ways to interpret this swap!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/109982">Give a Piece of Your Heart Swap</a> is open to experienced swappers who have done ten Type 3 swaps and have a 4.9 rating, or higher. Sign up by January 23rd!</p>

<p>And if you do happen to be a Valentine lover, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/search.php?action=search&amp;query=Valentine&amp;category=0&amp;location=all&amp;sort_by=Swap+Date">search for lots more Valentine swaps here</a>.</p>

&lt;/div&gt;-8700″ /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Happy Winter Solstice, everyone! (It is tomorrow in the Northern Hemisphere.) And, Happy Hanukkah, too! (It started last night.) Christmas is just four days away and 2012 will be here in just a little over a week! Wow. So many holidays, so little time! All sorts of holidays are celebrated by Swap-bot members and holiday swaps are very popular! Sadly, the time for Christmas snail mail swaps is winding down…. BUT there is still time for some e-swaps! Like the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/106956">Show Me Your Christmas Tree Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Schwallie">Schwallie</a>. For the <strong>international</strong> swap, you send each of your 10 partners a few pictures of your Christmas Tree and a few ornaments via email. You can also write a little about your tree and the significance of the ornaments you have chosen to share. What an easy and fun way to share your holiday traditions, while learning about lots of new ones in the process! <strong>Sign up by December 26th!</strong>Above is the Swap-bot HQ holiday tree from this year. It is just a mini potted tree, but I think it looks festive with the lights! Now I just need to make a little Ernie the Envie ornament…Whatever you celebrate this time of year, enjoy it!! Happy holidays!!</p>

<p>f you are a chocoholic like me, you might want to join the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/108060">Chocomania Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:BeeGon">BeeGon</a>. For the swap you only have one partner, but you send them three different chocolate bars:</p>

<ol>
  <li>One milk chocolate. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk.</li>
  <li>One white chocolate. White chocolate is formed from a mixture of sugar, cocoa butter and milk solids. Although its texture is similar to milk and dark chocolate, it does not contain any cocoa solids.</li>
  <li>And finally, one dark chocolate. Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone with a 4.7 rating, or higher, is welcome to join this <strong>international</strong> swap. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/108060">Sign up before January 8th!</a></p>

<p>I love the theme of the international <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/106591">Handmade Holiday Tolerance Card Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Amigirl">Amigirl</a>. It is a handmade greeting card swap that allows you to express your winter holiday wishes, no matter what you celebrate this time of year.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<p>_You will have 5 partners. You will send each of them one winter holiday card that you will make by hand.. Store-bought cards are not allowed, although of course you will likely be using store-bought elements. You can use any paper or fabric crafting techniques to make the cards. The cards should be pretty and something you’d want to display in your home. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><strong>ANY holiday celebrated this time of year is acceptable as your theme! You may do Christmas, New Year, Chanukah, Kwanzaa, Festivus, or whatever you celebrate at this time.</strong> You may certainly use your own spiritual or religious themes in the cards. Everyone is to exercise their tolerance here in what they receive and enjoy the well wishes no matter what religion they come from. Let’s all enjoy the variety of the spirituality that Swap-bot has. You are not to make any remark here about what type of holiday card you will accept, nor are any of you to rate down if you get a card that isn’t in line with your religious view. Tolerance is our watchword!&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>What a great swap! Diversity makes swapping more interesting and more fun!</p>

<p>(And in the same general theme, check out my <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/106322">Holiday Fun Matchbox Swap</a>. You can create a matchbox in any winter or holiday theme you choose! The photo above is from a previous year’s swap.)</p>

<p>PostalPix is sponsoring this swap and giving all participants <strong>25% off</strong> their photo print orders. I will send an email to all participants after the sign up deadline with the coupon code for the discount.</p>

<p>———</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong> New and experienced swappers are welcome. However anyone with recent low ratings or questionable behavior will be removed. This swap is for US residence only because PostalPix can currently only ship to US addresses. Also, you must have an iPhone in order to be able to use the PostalPix app. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/102484">Sign up now!</a></p>

<p>I do a Halloween matchbox swap every year… and this year is no different. I have already joined <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MelodyMoon">MelodyMoon’s</a> <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/99346">Halloween Matchbox Swap</a>. The <strong>international</strong> swap calls for one decorated 32-count matchbox to be sent to your one partner. As always, you can use my <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/rachels-matchbox-template/">matchbox template</a> to create your box from scratch or decorate an empty, commercial matchbox. Sign up before the end of September!</p>

<p><strong>Breaking news:</strong> As of this week, over 100,000 swaps have been hosted on Swap-bot! Wow!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj">Travis</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">I</a> (and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:crusher">Crusher</a>) have been running Swap-bot for almost six years and we never would have thought that so many swaps could have been hosted on our fun, little website. To celebrate this 100,000th swap milestone, I’m hosting a Swap-bot-themed mail swap — <strong><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/100000">the 100,000 Swap!!</a></strong></p>

<p>Everyone is welcome to join this easy swap. Each person will have one partner to whom they will send one piece of Swap-bot-themed snail mail. It can be a postcard, a letter, an ATC, an inchie, anything! The only strict requirement is that your item go through the postal mail and that it has some sort of Swap-bot decoration on it.</p>

<p>Let’s see how many Swap-bot creations we can send all over the world!</p>

<p>“There’s so many gorgeous colours and wonderful smells during this season. One incredible smell is a tasty dessert from our fall produce. Some of you have favourite cheesecake recipes (like pumpkin) or cake recipes (like carrot or zuchinni) or a favourite pie.”</p>

<p>That is a quote from the description of this week’s featured swap, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/99271">Autumn Decadence and a Surprise</a>. The <strong>international</strong> swap is being hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pinkrenegade">pinkrenegade</a>. For this postal mail swap, you will have one partner and you will share with them one tried and true favourite dessert recipe you use at this time of year. ALSO send a small fall surprise that can be profile base but it really is sender’s choice.</p>

<p>An easy and flexible swap to help us celebrate the change of seasons!</p>

<p>I love graffiti. I know that it is controversial because it can harm property, but I love the diversity of street art and the unique messages that the artists choose to express. I do not produce graffiti, but I do photograph it when I get a chance. (I took these two photos while out and about in New York.)</p>

<p>If you are also interested in graffiti or street art, join this week’s featured swap: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/97595"><strong>Graffiti Postcards</strong></a>. The international swap is hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kankalin">kankalin</a> and it consists of sending handmade graffiti postcards to each of your four partners.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<p><em>Take a photo of some nice graffiti art in your town and print out 4 copies, glue it on a sturdy cardboard and mail 1 naked (no envelops) to 4 partners. In the back of your card, you may want to write something about your photo (how did you find the graffiti, about the place etc).</em></p>

<p>Sign up for the swap by this Friday, August 26th. Users with at least a 4.8 rating are welcome.</p>

<p>I was going to college in Iowa on September 11th, 2001, but like all Americans, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">attacks on the World Trade Center</a> in New York (and the attack on the Pentagon and the plane crash in Pennsylvania) affected me greatly. Now that I live in New York I feel even more connected to the events. (Above is a photo I took of downtown NYC last month looking south from the middle of the Manhattan Bridge.)</p>

<p>This September 11th will be the 10th anniversary of the attacks. In remembrance of the event, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Megbomb">Megbomb</a> is hosting a <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/96147">We Will Never Forget postcard swap</a>. The swap instructions:</p>

<p><em>“You will send one postcard to each of your two partners. It would be wonderful for the postcards to be New York themed (handmade is great or store bought) but i will not make the theme a requirement because I want as much participation as possible. On the postcard please share a memory from that tragic event. Where you were, how you heard, if you knew anyone involved. If a postcard is not enough space, you may send a letter IN ADDITION TO the naked postcard that is the swap requirement. Newbies are allowed with well filled out profiles. Experienced swappers must have a 4.90.”</em></p>

<p>The swap is <strong>international</strong> and open for sign up until August 25th. I have joined the swap and look forward to taking a moment to reflect on the terrible, yet important, historic events of September 11th.</p>

If you like making Artist Trading Cards (ATCs) and need a new challenge, join the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/96499">Famous people in fruit or veggie disguise ATC swap</a>. The <strong>international</strong> swap is hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Bluebird1981">Bluebird1981</a> and is open to new users and experienced swappers with a 4.85 rating, or higher.</p>

<p>The swap instructions:</p>

<p>_“You choose a famous actor, actress, singer, group, athlete, …. and try to link their name to a piece of fruit or a vegetable. For example: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60140190@N08/5974018956/in/photostream/">John Lemon</a> (= John Lennon) seen here in the ATC by Bluebird1981. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The more creative you are, the better. Try to choose a real famous person, one that’s known around the globe, as this is an international swap! Draw or paint your idea on a standard ATC size card with a steady background. (2.5 x 3.5 inches). The head of the figure is a fruit or a vegetable. It has a small body. Be sure to take some time to create this ATC. You can use embellishments or stickers, but the figure has to be hand drawn or painted.”&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Such a funny idea! If you want to join to fun, sign up for the swap before this Friday, August 12th.</p>

<p>What is a mug rug? A mug rug is a cross between a coaster and a placemat. It is a handy thing to have on your desk as a place to set your coffee/tea and a little snack. Often mug rugs are quilted (like the one seen above from <a href="http://sew-fantastic.blogspot.com/2011/03/mug-rug-tutorial-scrappy-colorblock.html">Sew Fantastic</a>) and they are good way to use up fabric scraps, but I’ve also seen them woven.</p>

<p>Are you a fiber or fabric crafter who wants to try out this quick, new craft? Join the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/94034">Fun with Mug Rugs swap</a>! The international swap is being hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:theprincessr">theprincessr</a>. For the swap you make one 5 x 7 inch mug rug for your one partner. All swappers must be experienced and have over a 4.7 rating. Join the swap before this Saturday, July 16th.</p>

<p>I have featured <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/11/30/weekly-swap-holiday-fun-matchbox-swap/">matchbox swaps</a> in the past, and also a <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/08/30/weekly-featured-swap-book-thong-swap/">book thong swap</a>, but this is the first time that two have been combined in a featured swap… the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/93140">Book Thong in a Matchbox Swap</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The requirements:</strong> “You will have one partner, to whom you will send one decorated matchbox, and in it, one book thong. The book thong has to be hand made! You can use a store bought matchbox, but you must decorate it yourself.”</p>

<p>The international swap is hosted by &lt;A href=http://www.swap-bot.com/user:suki”&gt;suki&lt;/a&gt; and it is open to new users and experienced swappers with a 4.8 rating or higher. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/93140">Sign up before July 10th!</a></p>

<p><em>(The image above is an example of a book thong and its corresponding matchbox from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30615482@N07/">suki’s Flickr photos</a>.)</em></p>

<p>This week’s featured swap was inspired by the adorable fabric gift pouch seen above. A tutorial for the fabric pouch is featured on <a href="http://www.aspoonfulofsugardesigns.com/2011/02/fabric-gift-pouch.html">A Spoonful of Sugar</a>, and swap coordinator <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Csquaredcreations">Csquaredreations</a> thought they would be a fun item to swap. If you agree, join the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/93404">Super Cute Gift Pouch Swap</a>.</p>

<p>For the <strong>international</strong> swap, you make one of the fabric gift pouches for your partner. You do not have to fill the pouch with goodies, but that would be a fun way to spoil your partner! Sign up for the swap by Friday, June 24th. New users with a filled out profile and experienced swappers with a 5.0 rating are welcome to join. Remember to read the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/93404">full swap description</a> before signing up! Happy sewing and swapping!</p>

<p>This week’s featured swap is unique, but oh, so practical! The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/92765">Tea Wallet plus Tea swap</a> is being hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:snowqueen1426">snowqueen1426</a>. For the swap you must send your partner one sewn tea wallet, two wrapped tea bags, and a short message.</p>

<p>For the wallet: &lt;/i&gt;“You will sew not glue your wallet. Quality construction, made by you, that you are proud of…Use clean materials, with your choice of embellishments. The wallet should be able to store two or more packets of tea. The design, and colors will be senders choice.”&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>This swap is regional and restricted to only those with a US address. Usually, I like to feature international swaps so that anyone can participate, but I really like the idea of tea wallets and hope this inspires similar swaps.</p>

<p>Sign up for the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/92765">Tea Wallet plus Tea swap</a> by June 18th. All US swappers who have completed ten Type 3 swaps and have a rating of 4.9 or higher are welcome! Read the swap description for the full details.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<p><em>“This swap is for crafters who are owned by cats and love it! Pretty simple instructions. Make a nice craft for your partner’s cat (or cats). If you don’t own a cat, you can still join and craft. How you ask? Well, the craft you receive from your partner could go to a friend’s cat or one of your area’s local cat shelters…. Put some love and attention in your cat craft, please. Make it a craft your cat would love to play with and wouldn’t mind sending it off to another cat. Also, please tell your partner something about your cat or cats in a little note.”</em></p>

<p>You could make any sort of cat toy! Here are a few cat toy tutorials I quickly found online:</p>

<p><em>p.s. the silly photo is of my family’s cat, Marvin, when he was a kitten about 17 years ago. He didn’t really like being dressed in doll clothes, but he was a good sport. He has since passed on, but I love looking at the old photos of him.</em></p>

<p>I forgot how much I love whimsy jar swaps! The photo above is of a jar I made for a <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/33807">whimsy jar swap</a> way back in 2009!</p>

<p>So, this week I chose the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/90343">Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Baby Jar Of Whimsy</a> as the featured swap. The swap is hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TECHGIRL10">TECHGIRL10</a> and it is international. (But she is also hosting a <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/90330">USA-only version</a>.)</p>

<p>Whimsy jars are little glass jars full of tiny trinkets and craft supplies. You can see some examples <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=whimsy+jar&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ei=t2HDTd-5Mo_Atge32vyLBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1501&amp;bih=651">here</a> and TECHGIRL10 has some amazing ones in her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/techgirl10/">Flickr stream</a>. For this swap you can use a baby food jar (approximately 2.5 ozs.) and fill full of fun tidbits. The swap is sender’s choice so you can create your jar around any theme, but the jar must be decorated and filled to the top. Keep in mind that a lot of tiny items can fit even in a small jar, so be prepared to include dozens of items.</p>

<p>All participants must have a rating of 4.8 or above, with no unexplained 1’s or 3’s. The swap is not open to new users because you must have at least ten type 3 swaps. Be sure to read the full <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/90343">swap description</a> before signing up.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<p>_“Let’s Upcycle any type of tin or cardboard container into something functional and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>You will have one partner and redesign and decorate either one cardboard, plastic, or tin container and send to your assigned swap partner.</p>

<p>Non-Profile Specific — No need to wait for assigned partners, go ahead and start on your container upscycle project and you’ll be ready to send once your partner is assigned.</p>

<p>You may cut your container, alter it into anything you can imagine and decorate with fabric, felt, decorative scrapbooking paper, vintage images, stamped and cut out images, etc.” &lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Such a fun a creative idea! Plus, who couldn’t use a pretty, new container for organizing craft supplies! <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/85090">Sign up before May 14th</a> and then get started on your upcycled container.</p>

<p>Oh, how I used to love <a href="http://www.peewee.com/">Pee Wee’s Playhouse</a> when I was a kid! It was such a weird, fun, wacky show. I wanted to live in the Playhouse for real. (Remember the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKcYGOIJhqo">theme song</a>? That is Cindi Lauper singing!) My mom had taped the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pee-Wees-Playhouse-Christmas-Special/dp/B0002IQASG">Christmas Special</a> – using our VCR, of course – and we would watch it every year!</p>

<p>So, I couldn’t resist featuring the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/89334?new=1">Pee Wee’s Playhouse ATC Swap</a> this week! The international swap is hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:missmuffcake">missmuffcake</a> and it is open for sign up through April 29th.</p>

<p>For the swap, you create one ATC for your one partner that features one character or element from Pee Wee’s Playhouse. It could feature Pee Wee, Miss Yvonne, Mailman Mike, Cowboy Curtis, Jambi the Genie, Pterri, Conky, Chairry, or any of the other crazy characters! (One of my favorites was Chicky Baby, back-up singer for the Cool Cat, all-puppet, bebop band.)</p>

<p>All users with a 4.8 rating, or higher are welcome in the swap. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/89334?new=1">Sign up now!</a></p>

<p>Just for fun: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiDHUNiurqY&amp;feature=related">Pee Wee gets an iPad on Funny Or Die</a>.</p>

		<p>This week’s featured swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/85947">Your Memoir in Six Words Postcard Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:AlyssD">AlyssD</a>. I love the idea behind this swap: Write the story of your life in only six words.</p>

<p>For inspiration and examples, watch the short video above. It is the promo piece for the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Not-Quite-What-Was-Planning/dp/0061374059"><em>Not Quite What I Was Planning: Six-Word Memoirs by Writers Famous and Obscure</em></a>, a collection of these short and poignant memoirs.</p>

<p>The postcard swap is international and open for sign up through March 30th. For the swap, you will write your memoir in only six words on the back of three postcards (of your choosing) and send one (naked, i.e. not in an envelope) to each of your three partners. Everyone, including new users is welcome in this swap.</p>

<p>Swap-bot’s Memoir: Sent item, got one back. Sweet.</p>

<p>I love this swap idea!! I just joined the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/84903">Instant Postcard Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:OverMoon">OverMoon</a>. Instant postcards are a new concept for me, but basically they are Polaroids (or other instant film photographs) sent “naked” (without an envelope) as a postcard. You put the stamp directly on the photo and write your recipient’s address on the white potion of the photo. (The address info has been removed from the two instant postcards seen above.) Very cool! If you own an instant camera (and film), sign up for <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/84903">Instant Postcard Swap</a> by March 21st. Then, simply take your photo and send it to your one international partner by March 25th.</p>

		<p>Postcards are such fun, easy, quick things to swap. This week I found two unique postcard swaps to share with you:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/83158"><strong>Hablamos Espanol</strong></a> – For this swap, hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ssshauna">ssshauna</a>, you send one postcard (in an envelope) to your one partner with a message written in Spanish on it. Sign up before February 21st.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/79339"><strong>Pi Day Cards</strong></a> – Did you know that March 14th is Pi Day? If you are a match lover, sign up for this swap hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:thesuester">thesuester</a> and make or buy a Pi-themed postcard for your partner. Sign up before February 23rd.</p>

<p>Both swaps are international and have only one partner. You are allowed to send traditional style greeting cards for each swap, if you prefer. Both swaps allow new users.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.favecrafts.com/">FaveCrafts.com</a> is an awesome craft website that has thousands of free craft projects, home decor ideas, and DIY tips. I have subscribed to their email newsletter for quite a while and was super-pumped when they <a href="http://www.favecraftsblog.com/special-announcement-introducing-the-favecrafts-valentine-card-swap/">announced</a> their <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/81159">FaceCrafts Valentine’s Card Swap</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-02-at-11.17.14-AM.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-02-02 at 11.17.14 AM" width="470" height="120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7524" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-02-at-11.17.14-AM-300x76.png 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-02-at-11.17.14-AM.png 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>For the swap, each participant creates three Valentine’s cards — one for each of their three partners. “Cards can be designed and made however you want, as long as they’re homemade. This means die-cutting, sewing, photo-shopping, glitter, etc. Make sure the design you choose is easy enough to make multiples of, because you’ll have to make 3.” The swap is a great way to get your creative juices flowing and get some lovely Valentine’s mail in return!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/81159">FaceCrafts Valentine’s Card Swap</a> is currently in the “Top Swap” position on Swap-bot, with over 90 participants already signed up! But, there is still time to participate! Sign up for the swap before this Friday, February 4th, and start spreading the Valentine’s Day love!</p>

<p>——</p>

<p><em>p.s. Friday is also the last day to sign up for the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/82038">I Love Swap-bot Ultimate Swap</a> and get your bonus pack of Swap-bot goodies!</em></p>

<p>For the swap, you make an ATC, a handmade postcard, and a matchbox for your one partner. All of your creations must incorporate Ernie the Envie (seen below).</p>

<p>More info from the swap description: “Fill your matchbox with brads, buttons, ribbons, faux postages or other little embellishments. It may also be swap-bot themed or what you think your partner may use. Anything goes, but make sure you send something you would love to receive. For your postcards, you can do a collage, doodle or whatever. At the back, write why you love swap-bot and a tip on how you keep track of your swaps. Don’t forget to include your name, your swap-bot username, and your email address in your package.” Sign up before February 4th, and send before the 18th.</p>

<p>If you need some inspiration, check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/galleries/72157622266549443/">Flickr Gallery of Ernie Creations</a> and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/3922886917/in/set-72157602135475903/">Ernie matchbox I made last year</a>.</p>

<p>It is that time of year… whether you hate Valentine’s Day or love it, it will be here soon! And this week I chose a unique valentine swap to feature: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/79880">Very Visible Valentines</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Corazon">Corazon</a>. The aim of the swap is for each participant to send valentines through the mail that all viewers can enjoy. From the swap description:</p>

<p>_Don’t hide your Valentine’s Day emotions in a plain white envelope, let the love show! This is your chance to share Valentine’s Day with your mail carrier, post office, your partner’s mail carrier as well as your partner!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Make a Valentine’s Day postcard or decorate an envelope in a Valentine’s Day theme. Here are some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>heart shaped card</li>
  <li>sequins/jewels</li>
  <li>beads</li>
  <li>glitzy sewing trim</li>
  <li>fun color combos such as pink/purple or black/red/silver</li>
  <li>old Valentine pictures or quotes</li>
  <li>fun magazine pictures</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be making 2 Valentines, sending 1 to each of 2 partners. You will have 3 weeks after the last sign up day to make your cards, so please make something you would be proud to receive. Have fun and make sure you leave a Valentine’s Day message for your partner so he/she knows who you are to rate you!&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Any swapper with over a 4.8 rating is welcome to join, but sign up fast! The sign up deadline is this Friday, the 14th. Whether you in love with the holiday or not, this is your chance to make and receive some unique Valentine’s greetings!</p>

<p>I have been somewhat obsessed with garland decorations lately. There are so many inspiring ideas on the internet! For example, the pretty tassel garland above is from <a href="http://www.confettisystem.com/">Confetti System</a> – an extremely cool artist duo that creates amazing installations. If you’d like to try your hand at making your own handmade garland, join the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/78946">Banners, Pennants, and Garlands Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:saellys">saellys</a>.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<p><em>Garlands are beautiful all year–especially if they’re handmade! In this swap, you will send one yard (36″) of handmade garland, pennants, or banners to one partner. These can be paper, fabric, beads, or any other hangable ephemera on sturdy string, ribbon, wire, or anything else that can support the weight. This is sender’s choice. Get creative! And make sure you leave space at either end to tie to a nail or support, or add metal rings or washers to act as grommets.</em></p>

<p>The swap is international and accepts experienced swappers with a 4.75 rating, or higher. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/78946">Sign up before Friday!!</a></p>

<p>I am a sucker for glitter! It seems even more appropriate during the holidays…</p>

<p>If you are a glitter lover like me, you may want to join the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/79087">Glitter Blast ATC Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:bratface99">bratface99</a>.</p>

<p>The swap is international and pretty self-explanitory… Make one Artist Trading Card using glitter in some way for each of your two partners. The ATCs must be normal size – 2.5 x 3.5 inches – but other than that, you can interpret the theme any way you’d like. Sign up for the swap before December 24th, and send your ATCs before January 7th. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/79087">Read the swap description</a> for all the details.</p>

It is a hard question, but fun to think about. And, what better time than the holidays to reminisce and read about some of the best gifts ever? Join the most recent in the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/78556">Postcard Confessions swap series</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:thehappyhoneybee">thehappyhoneybee</a> and you can do just that.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/78556">Postcard Confessions – Best Gift Ever swap description</a>:</p>

<p>_It’s time for Postcard Confessions, round five! ‘Tis the season of giving…so what’s the best gift you’ve ever given someone else?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Write a note to your partner describing the most wonderful gift you’ve ever given another person. Maybe you knitted something that was exactly what your mother wanted, maybe you put together an amazingly creative package for your partner, or maybe you gave something very simple…but it had an incredibly meaningful impact upon the other person.</p>

<p>It’s nice to hear stories of kindness and generosity around this time of year…and perhaps you’ll receive some ideas for gift-giving yourself!</p>

<p>Postcards are sender’s choice and can be handmade, clean vintage, or store-bought, but please be sure to send a card that you’d like to receive. Choosing a postcard illustrating the theme or season is nice, but not strictly required. They should be written on and stamped (no envelope), and everyone will have 1 partner, with 1 postcard to send. Easy peasy.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>The swap is open to anyone with a well-filled out profile, but make sure you sign up before this Saturday, December 11th!</p>

<p>There are so many Christmas and holiday-themed postcard and greeting card swaps being hosted on Swap-bot right now that you are sure to find one that looks interesting.</p>

<p>For this week’s featured swap, I chose two easy postcard swaps that are of a “holiday” theme, but that are open to all types of winter traditions. If you are interested in swapping postcards with people from all over the world and to learning about different holiday celebrations, join one or both of these swaps:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/77908">Holiday Traditions Postcard Swap</a></strong> – An international postcard swap hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ladytiger7647">ladytiger7647</a>. Send one store-bought or handmade holiday or winter postcard that describes one of your holiday traditions to your one partner. Easy and fun! Sign up before November 30th.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/77327">Winter Cheer Postcard Swap</a></strong> – An international swap hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Goldfoxxe">Goldfoxxe</a>. Send one holiday or winter-themed postcard to each of your five partners. On each card, describe a winter holiday that you celebrate. Sign up before December 5th.</p>

<p>Both of these swaps are open to new users and also welcome participants of all faiths. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Festivus, Yule, New Years, or any other winter holiday, you can share your traditions and learn about others in these two postcard swaps. Happy holidays!</p>

<p>Winter is coming! <em>(The photo above is me and Crusher last December, but I thought it conveyed the right winter feelings…)</em></p>

<p>If you are sure to be doing some winter crafting, join this week’s featured swap – <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76006">the Mini Inspiration Winter Kit Swap</a> – and refresh your craft supplies. The international swap is hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:1Scrapper">1Scrapper</a> and it is only open for sign up through the end of the week (November 20th). For the swap, you send you one partner a small pack of winter-themed craft items. Your “mini inspiration kit” should include about ten unique items and have a value of approximately $8. Be creative with your items (don’t just send ten buttons) and package everything in a sweet way — wrapped and tied with ribbon or placed in a wintery box. The kits must be mailed by December 1st so that everyone gets them in time for winter crafting.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76006">the Mini Inspiration Winter Kit Swap</a> description for more info.</p>

<p><em>Do you LOVE the 80’s as much as I do?? I’m an 80’s chick, so what I would love love LOVE is an 80’s themed Dotee! You can make your dotee in any 80’s style. Think Madonna, The Cure, Punky Brewster, Michael Jackson, punk rock, headbands, leg warmers, mixed matched socks, neon clothes, jelly bracelets, crimped hair, etc. Come on all you hardcore 80’s girls, let’s make this swap “like, totally tubular”!!!</em></p>

<p>Sounds like a lot of fun! To join the swap you must have over a 4.9 rating and have completed at least five swaps. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/77062">Sign up before Monday, November 15th!</a></p>

I am always looking for interesting ATC swap variations and this one caught my attention this week: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76051">Interactive ATC II: Pocket Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:starrgazer">starrgazer</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76051">Interactive ATC II: Pocket Swap</a> is international and open to anyone who has completed five mail swaps and has a 4.9 rating. For the swap, you make one interactive ATC that incorporates a pocket for your one partner. Directions from the swap description:</p>

<p>“This card will need to feature some sort of pocket. Intrepret the theme as you wish as long as there is a pocket, with something tucked inside of course. Get creative, think outside the box. Make a quality piece, something that you would enjoy recieving. Senders choice, so you may begin creating at anytime, but profiles can always be inspiring!”</p>

<p>Sign up for the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76051">Interactive ATC II: Pocket Swap</a> before November 12th!!</p>

<p>If you enjoy art history you should join the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74412">Art History ATC Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:tyttoastronautti">tyttoastronautti</a>. The swap is the first in what hopes to be a series of art history-inspired swaps. Each swap in the series will be inspired by a different period in art history, the first one being <strong>Art Nouveau</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> is an international movement and style of art that was most popular at the turn of the 20th century. It is characterized by organic, especially floral and other plant-inspired motifs, as well as highly stylized, flowing curvilinear forms. Artists include Alphonse Mucha, Louis Comfort Tiffany, and Gustav Klimt, among many others.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74412">Art History ATC Swap</a> is international and each participant makes one art nouveau ATC for their one partner. You must have completed at least three mail swaps and have a 4.8 rating, or higher, to join. Sign up before October 30th.</p>

<p>Usually, I try to highlight international swaps that everyone can participate in, but this week I am featuring a USA-only swap. In the US, our general elections are coming up on November 2nd, so this week’s featured swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74251">Vote on November 2nd! A Postcard Reminder swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:melusina">melusina</a>.</p>

<p>This postcard swap is quite easy, but it will help to spread the message that voting is important no matter what your politics. Simply mail one postcard to your one partner – the postcard must have an image that will help remind others to vote on November 2nd. The recipient of the postcard can then hang it in a public location as a voting reminder.</p>

<p>Sign up for the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74251">Vote on Nov. 2nd swap</a> by this Friday, October 15th. It is a great way to help get ourselves and others involved in our democracy!</p>

<p>This week, I am getting back to Swap-bot’s roots and featuring the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74119">October Magic Yarn Ball Swap</a>. The very first featured swap here on the blog was a <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2007/01/21/weekly-featured-swap-magic-yarn-ball/">Magic Yarn Ball Swap</a>, but recently I haven’t seen many similar swaps… until now!</p>

<p>The October Magic Yarn Ball Swap is hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cinderella730">cinderella730</a> and it is international. Make sure to sign up before the deadline this Friday, October 9th!</p>

<p>So, what exactly is a magic yarn ball? Basically, you wrap cool, little treasures up in a ball of yarn, and give it as a gift. As the recipient crafts with the yarn the treasures fall out one by one, and they discover the fun as they knit or crochet. You can search <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=magic+yarn+ball&amp;w=all&amp;m=&amp;s=&amp;mt=&amp;referer_searched=">“magic yarn balls”</a> on Flickr and view many examples.</p>

For example, I spend a lot of time on my <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/">personal blog</a>. I take lots of photos for it and spend time writing about things that are important to me. It is like my scrapbook and I love to share it with others, which is why I joined this week’s featured swap: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/73668">I Love Your Blog!</a></p>

<p>This international email swap is hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:jex">Jex</a>, and all users with a 4.85 rating, or higher, are welcome to join. Everyone will be assigned seven partners, and here are the swap instructions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Send your partners the link to your blog.</li>
  <li>Then, go to your partners’ blogs and grab a button or graphic. You have to link to them in your own blog, so your followers and readers will know your partners later.</li>
  <li>Write a blog entry talking about this swap, and write what you like the most of your partners’ blogs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sign up for the I Love Your Blog swap by October 15th and discover some awesome new blogs! (Like <a href="http://jexyland.blogspot.com/">Jex’s blog</a>, for example!)</p>

<p>This week, I am being a little bit selfish and featuring my own swap, the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/70350">Happy Halloween Matchbox Swap</a>. It is a fairly self-explanitory matchbox swap: send one Halloween-themed matchbox to your one partner. There are already more than 60 people signed up – yay! – and anyone with a 4.8, or higher, rating is welcome to join. Sign up before September 30th and send your matchbox before October 15th. I always love Halloween matchboxes – they end up being so creative!</p>

<p>Halloween is a popular swap theme every year. Here are a few more Halloween swaps you might want to check out:</p>

<p>This week, I am featuring two versions of a very unique swap idea, both hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pahasiga">pahasiga</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/72613"><strong>Fun “Mathbox” for math lovers</strong></a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/72614"><strong>Fun “Mathbox” for math haters</strong></a></p>

<p>The idea for these two swaps came when pahasiga kept misspelling the word “matchbox” and thought it must be a sign to create a math swap. Math is all around us! Why not incorporate it into our swaps?!</p>

<p>The swap directions are pretty simple: <strong>1) take a box</strong>, and <strong>2) decorate it and fill with fun math</strong>. But what exactly is fun math? Here is a description from the swap…</p>

<p>_“There are things that you maybe have never thought to have a connection to math. A round button with stripes on it? – it is a circle with chords dividing it into segments – very mathematical! Beads that are all round (spheres) or long ones (cylinders), inchies (squares) and ATCs (rectangles)… Unsharpened pencils are prisms or cylinders, and when they are sharpened, then they are prisms or cylinders with a cone on one end. And I won’t even start on ribbons – I swear I have read about a way of building up all geometry from ribbons.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Also, there are any kind of math-related jokes; funny, fake or just interesting math problems; math puzzles – logic problems, sudokus of all kinds, KenKen, Slither link, nonograms, light up, Hashiwokakero (bridges), Shikaku (rectangles), Nurikabe (Islands in the Stream), Dominosa, mazes, Kakuro, fill-in-crosswords, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>You can cut problems out of magazines or books, copy/remake from them (giving credit where due), or even create the jokes/problems/puzzles yourself. Don’t stuff your box with only one kind of things – let there be at least four kinds of fun math in the box, and let there be at least one math of a puzzle type – not only buttons and beads.”&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/72613">Math Lovers swap</a> you can include difficult math problems in your box. In the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/72614">Math Haters swap</a>, only send the easiest of puzzles. Both swaps have a sign up deadline of this Sunday, September 19th. You must have over a 4.9 rating, with at least three ratings for package swaps, to sign up. Show your math love and swap some math fun!</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of book thongs? They are bookmarks made out of a thin ribbon or string with beads or charms on either end. They are a pretty way to mark your spot in a book and they are easy to make!</p>

<p>If you want to try making a few book thongs, join this week’s featured swap: the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/70805">Book Thong Swap</a>, hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:craftsgalore">craftsgalore</a>. The swap is international and open to those swappers with over a 4.8 rating. Sign up before September 10th, and then start working on your two book thongs. One will be sent to each of your two partners.</p>

<p>Looking through all of the available Swap-bot swaps always makes me happy. There are so many to choose from in every possible theme – I love it!</p>

<p>The wide range of choices also makes it hard to choose just one featured swap each week, but I managed to narrow it down to a few Dotee Doll swaps this week:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/69234">How much is that Dog Dotee in the Window</a></strong> – A cute, unique, and international dotee doll swap hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CozetteAsahi">CozetteAsahi</a>.

<p>I am a fan of cupcakes. I love that they are single serving and so darn cute, so I couldn’t resist signing up for this week’s featured swap: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/70014">Make Cupcake Toppers for Your Partner!</a> The international swap is hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:thehappyhoneybee">thehappyhoneybee</a>, and here are the instructions:</p>

<p><em>“You will create one set of flat cupcake toppers (not 3D so we can keep our postage down by mailing in a regular envelope) with one dozen toppers. These are profile-based cupcake toppers, so have a look through your partner’s bio and see what kinds of things he or she might enjoy. The toppers can be of your own original design or from any of the free downloadable templates floating out there, just as long as it’s something nice you’ve chosen specifically based on your partner’s likes and dislikes.”</em></p>

<p>If you aren’t sure how to get started on your toppers, here are a few helpful and inspirational links:</p>

<p>This week’s featured swap is <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/69608">ATC Inspired by Your Username</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Arabella">Arabella</a>. I think it would be fascinating to “see” the story behind other swappers’ usernames!</p>

<p>The swap instructions: “Your ATC can be a literal interpretation of your username (like CupcakeLover making an ATC featuring a cupcake surrounded by hearts, for example), or more abstract if you like. Include a note to your partner explaining the connection to your username, and tell your partner a little about how you chose the name. Be sure to include the swap and username on the back of the ATC!”</p>

<p>You only send one Artist Trading Card to one international partner for this swap. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/69608">Sign up by August 16th.</a></p>

<p>You may have noticed that the Swap-bot blog was pretty quiet for the last week… well, all of your faithful Swap-bot admin members (<a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">me</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj">travisj</a>) were on vacation. We had a great time visiting Disney World with our family, but now we are back home and back on the job!</p>

<p>In honor of our fun trip, I’ve chosen the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/68330">Summer Vacation Postcard swap</a> as this week’s featured swap. It is an fun, international postcard swap hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:angkb">angkb</a>. Simply pick up two extra postcards while you are on your summer vacation (I picked up some extra Minnie &amp; Mickey postcards for my partners), and send one to each of your two partners once parters are assigned.</p>

<p>The sign up for the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/68330">Summer Vacation Postcard swap</a> is open until August 20th, so you still have plenty of time to get home from your summer travels before it starts. I can’t wait to see where everyone visited this summer!</p>

<p>I just love party decorations, especially garland (or bunting). It can make any space more festive!</p>

<p>So, this week I am featuring the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/66713">Mini Garland Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Wanda">Wanda</a>. The international swap is so cute and clever. Each participant creates a mini, two-foot long garland for their one partner. The garland can be of any theme or style – sender’s choice. It can have a message, like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28821647@N00/4765144270/">Wanda’s seen above</a>, or it can be plain. Each garland must contain at least twelve pennants and they must be made of something sturdier than text weight paper.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/66713">Mini Garland Swap</a> is only open for sign up through the 19th, so head over and read the full description if you are interested! The swap is open to international swappers with over a 4.5 rating and you’ll have until August 2nd to send your garland.</p>

<p>If you need some more inspiration, check out the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/06/24/handmade-marketplace-etsy-bunting-picks/">Etsy Bunting Picks</a> that were featured on the blog last month.</p>

<p>I don’t often feature “Type 1: Electronic” swaps as the weekly swap, but there are some great ones out there in the Swap-bot universe! So, this week I am featuring , an email swap hosted by . For the swap, you will email two photos of your own creative space (your office, craft corner, art studio, etc) with a description to each of your five partners. (Above is a photo of my office space – on a clean day – where I do all of my working and crafting.)</p>

<p>More instructions from the swap description:</p>

<p><em>“Please include a brief summary of what we’ll see, features you’re proud of, why exactely you need your cat sleeping in that exact place, procrastination devices we might spy 😉 … and please tell us what you’re doing there – writing, crafting, woodwork, alienating significant others, developing world domination plans…”</em></p>

<p>It is an easy email swap, but I always find it fascinating to see where other people create! New users are welcome in the swap, but everyone must have a completed profile and zero no-sends. The sign up date is coming up quickly on Monday, July 5th, so if you want to share your creative space with your fellow swappers!</p>

For this international swap, you alter three store-bought postcards (one for each of your three partners) by putting a hat on at least one human or animal on the front of the card. The swap description describes the requirements best: _“For this swap you will have 3 partners and you will send 1 altered postcard to each partner. The cards you send must be store bought cards which you have altered by putting a hat on at least one person, animal, or object on the front of each card. You can of course add more than one hat and alter the cards in any other way you like. You may use any method you like to alter the cards such as drawing, collage, stickers, stamping, etc, but remember that the card needs to survive the post so make it strong.&lt;/p&gt; Please send your altered cards “naked” through the post without an envelope and use a real stamp if possible (unless your partner prefers otherwise). Don’t forget to write a nice message to each of your partners on the backs of the cards.” &lt;/i&gt; It is a fun and easy postcard swap with a twist! All swappers with over a 4.5 rating are welcome to join. The sign up deadline for the in June 30th. &lt;div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-3071px;"&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;/a&gt;Carving your own custom stamps is easier than one might think. You can make them out of special linoleum blocks, or out of simple erasers. This week’s featured swap is the coordinated by and it is your chance to give stamp carving a try! It is an international sender’s choice swap, which means you can hand carve any type of image on your stamp that you choose. Each participant has just one partner to send to, and the only requirement is that your stamp be at least 1 inch by 1 inch in size. You must have completed at least ten mail swaps in order to participate. Check out to learn how to carve your own stamps.

It is just what it sounds like: art made from altered metal forks. You can view some examples of the art form on <a href="http://www.fork-art.com/">www.fork-art.com</a>.</p>

<p>This week’s featured swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/59601">Altered Fork Art Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pummica">pummica</a>, and I believe it is the first time a fork art swap has been hosted on Swap-bot. For this international swap, each participant creates one piece of fork art for their one partner using at least one metal fork. “You can paint them, bend them, make holes in them. Your art can be more than just one and you can ad non-fork things to it but the bulk of the art should be the fork.” It definitely sounds like an interesting new art form to try out! If you want to give it a try, sign up for the swap now – the sign up deadline is this Wednesday, May 5th! Make sure to read the full <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/59601">swap desctiption</a> for the full requirements.</p>

For the swap, you simply send an envelope full of brightly colored craft and collage items to each of your three partners. You can send flat crafting supplies such as paper, stickers, ribbon, fabric scraps, etc, but ALL of the items you send must be brightly colored and or neon/fluorescent! Make sure to check out the for all of the details and requirements. The swap is international and open to experienced swappers with at least a 4.5 overall rating and serious, new Swap-bot users. Sign up before the end of April to get in on this fluorescent fun!!</p>

I may be moving into the territory of over-kill when it comes to promoting this swap, but I am really excited about the sentiment behind the . Plus, this stash busting swap is extremely easy and such a great way to reduce the amount of lovely, but neglected craft items hanging around our craft rooms. Why not give your unused supplies a new shot at life by sending them to your swap partner? And, in return you will receive an envelope full of inspiring and new-to-you supplies from your partner — It’s win-win! Reduce your stash and freshen up your stash all in one fun ! The is international and open to new and experienced members alike. Sign up closes on Earth Day, April 22nd. Each participant will then send a 6 x 9 inch, or larger, envelope full of craft supplies – like pretty paper scraps, fabric, yarn, ribbon, stickers, felt, embellishments, etc – to their one swap partner by the end of the month. Easy peasy!The is a joint project being hosted by a bunch of crafty website (including Swap-bot!) in honor of Earth Day. You can take the April Stash Bust pledge to not buy any new craft supplies this month and instead create projects from items you already have on hand. The intention of the project is to get us all thinking about what we buy and how we use it, or don’t use it, while reducing the crafty clutter that we all seem to accumulate! For more info, check out . There is even a you can enter to win an awesome prize pack! &lt;div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-2808px;"&gt;</p>

<p>You already know that I love altered matchboxes, but what you might not know is that I have never tried making a “matchbox chest of drawers.” That is going to change, though, because I have signed up for this week’s featured swap: hosted by . For this international swap, each participant will send a three-drawer matchbox “dresser” to their one partner. The dresser should be decorated in a spring theme and each drawer should contain items based on three specific categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drawer 1: Spring Colours. Fill this drawer with items that are the colours of spring (yellow,lavender, pink etc.) Of course, please check your partner’s likes and dislikes for colours. If they only like blue,for example, there is lots of pale blue shades to choose from.</li>
  <li>Drawer 2: Spring Words: How does spring make you feel? What does it mean to you? Share your thoughts in phrases or words with your partner. Are there special holidays that happen in your country? Let them know!</li>
  <li>Drawer 3: Spring Fling This is a profile surprise you can pop into the last drawer!</li>
</ul>
<div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-3636px;">
</div>

<div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-3409px;">
</div>

<p>The matchbox chest of drawers are created by stacking together three separate 32-count matchboxes. If you need help with yours, check out the . I also really like made by Swap-bot user, , on Flickr. You can find many more ideas by searching on Flickr.</p>

<p>Only users who have completed at least five Type 3: Package or Craft swaps can participate and you must have a 4.9 overall rating, or higher. The sign up deadline is not until April 30th, so you have time to complete the pre-required swaps and tell your friends about this fun spring swap!</p>

		<p>_ [of Crusher on the swap page &amp; you can find them on my Flickr , too]. _Next, Print the photo out. Then, cut out Crusher so you end up with just a photo of Crusher. Tip: You may want to reinforce the photo with cardboard or card stock on the back side. Once you have your Crusher likeness, tape a stick to the back (a paint stick works well, so does a wooden spoon or ruler, basically any type of handle will do). Now you have Crusher-on-a-stick.&lt;/p&gt; You will take a photograph of your little Crusher-on-a-stick sharing a day with you and send it to your one partner. Crusher can go to the beach with you, show up in your birthday photos, play with your kids, be seen at work with you, or your Crusher-on-a-stick may be sitting in a grocery cart or driving your car. The sky is the limit! Crusher can end up anywhere. For this swap, you just mail your photo of your Crusher-on-a-stick to your partner. However, we would all like to see your photos. You can post them on Flickr at my newly created Swap-bot page, , and I will make a forum thread when the swap starts. &lt;/i&gt; I am already signed up for this great swap but you have until March 9th to join. The swap is a “Type 3” craft swap that will be sent in the mail, but I would also love to publish the resulting photos here on the blog, too… Can’t wait to see where Crusher ends up!</p>

Pennant banners (or bunting, or garland, depending on where you are from) are very popular right now, and for good reason! They are a fun and easy way to decorate a space for a party, or for everyday. This swap requires that each participant create their own original pennant banner with five triangles or squares which spell out the word &amp;#8220;DREAM&amp;#8221; attached to a ribbon or cord. The triangles or squares should each be the size of an Artist Trading Card (2.5 x 3.5 inches) and they should be created in a vintage style.

<p>More info from the swap description on the style: “Senders choice color-wise, but it MUST be soft and dreamy and vintage in style – a touch of glitter is always nice. You can start creating as soon as you sign up. Think vintage trims and tassels, think ribbon and lace. Vintage embellishments would be nice, but any cute pictures or stickers that match, diamontes or flowers. I usually add a fringe, tassels or beading to each bottom but its up to you.”</p>

<p>The swap is international and open for sign up through February 26th.</p>

<p>For a little inspiration, here is a classic love poem:</p>

<p>How Do I Love Thee?</p>

<p>by Elizabeth Barrett Browning</p>

<p>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.</p>

<p>I love thee to the depth and breadth and height</p>

<p>My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight</p>

<p>For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.</p>

<p>I love thee to the level of everyday’s</p>

<p>Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.</p>

<p>I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;</p>

<p>I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.</p>

<p>I love thee with the passion put to use</p>

<p>In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.</p>

<p>I love thee with a love I seemed to lose</p>

<p>With my lost saints, I love thee with the breath,</p>

<p>Smiles, tears, of all my life! and, if God choose,</p>

<p>I shall but love thee better after death.</p>

<p>We each will have just one partner in this international swap, for whom we will create a Valentine or February theme matchbox. We will also fill the matchbox with similarly-themed goodies. Most participants will probably choose to do a Valentine’s Day or Love theme, but some examples of additional February themes include Chinese New Year, President’s Day, MLK Jr Day, Black History Month, etc. This swap is sender’s choice and anything goes as long as you send a high quality matchbox that you would love to receive. The sign up deadline for the is February 3rd, and all packages must be sent by February 8th. You must have a 4.9 rating to participate, but new users are also welcome. (I angel my matchbox swaps, so consider this swap a no risk opportunity to swap with some new folks.)</p>

<p>p.s. Swap-bot will be hosting a craft night event at on February 1st that will feature these matchbox Valentine’s… more details to come!</p>

		<p>This week I am featuring a unique mail art swap, but you must sign up soon! The deadline for the is this Friday, January 1st! The swap is being hosted by and she explains the requirements very well in the swap description:</p>

<p><em>Take a piece of paper (the size and color is up to you) and on one side fill it with all the things you want to rid yourself of in the new year, like emotional distresses, love problems, self esteem issues, etc, or focus on one large issue. Scrible, draw, list, collage, paint, etc. Then on the other side, write many positive things you want to acomplish in the new year. You dont need to have either of these in paragraph form, you should just write whatever comes to mind, even if its only two or three large words and a bunch of doodles! When youve done this, fold the envelope up with the negative things you want to rid yourself of in the inside,where nobody can see it, and with the positive things facing outside . Inside this envelope you can put small things that relate to what you want to get rid of, like old bills, a picture of a past lover, a photo of someone who you cannot stand, or even small objects that relate, like maybe a small wooden heart, etc.. Then seal the envelope. On the outside, make sure to write your username, because your partner will not even open the envelope!! They will rate you, then burn it to ash after reading the positive things written on the outside!! This swap is for YOUR gain. The more you believe in the power of attraction, and the more you believe that you make your own destiny, the more likely this is to work for you! Think of it as mail art, but with a purpose!</em></p>

<p>You send your 2010 envelope to just one partner by the January 7th deadline. You must have a 4.9 rating, or higher, to join the . Happy New Year!</p>

So, your blank handmade card and its blank envelope will be sent in another outer envelope… Your partner will then be able to use the greeting card during the holidays.

		<p>I have never featured an electronic (email) swap here on the blog before, but with the current state of the economy I figure we can all appreciate a high-quality, but totally free swap. This week’s featured swap is the . The swap, which is hosted by , is international and open for sign up through October 30th. For the swap, you write a list of 100 things that you would like to do before you die, then you email that list to each of your five partners before November 8th.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<p>_“I’ve had some really eye opening experiences in the last several months in my life and it got me thinking of things I would like to do in my life time. You know things you put off, or things you think heck I can’t do that, even things that you thought you could never do. But if suddenly you thought my gosh I may never be able to, wouldn’t you want a list and try to check off one thing as you go? I do – at least, I want to try.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>So, I thought why not see what everyone else wants to do.This could be fun, it amazes me sometimes that others have the same ideas, but are afraid to mention them. The time to mention them is now.”&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>I like the idea of putting your goals on paper – it gives you a clearer picture of what you want out of life. This swap motivates you to do just that!</p>

		<p>This week’s featured swap, , is a truly unique and happy swap. The international swap is hosted by and it is open to anyone (with no recent 1 or 3 ratings) who wants to hear good news from around the world. Here are the swap directions from the :</p>

<p><em>“I guess we’re all tired of reading about bad news on the newspapers – murders, violence, wars – so what about sending to your swap partner a journal full of GOOD and HAPPY news taken from your local/national newspapers? That’s what you have to do: you’ll collect as much newspapers’ cuttings as you can and stick them into a journal/notebook, then send it to your swap partner. It’s quite cheap because you only have to buy a journal, but you can also make it on your own. If you read non-English newspapers, you can translate only the article’s title or the whole article if it’s short. The articles MUST talk about GOOD, HAPPY, NICE, or FUNNY things.”</em></p>

<p>The swap sign up deadline for is October 25th, but the mail deadline is not until January 23rd. That gives you plenty of time to collect lots of feel-good news stories for your partner. What a great way to stay positive and focused on the good things that happen in the world everyday!</p>

The swap is a bit detailed, so I will quote the requirements directly from the excellent swap description:</p>

<p><em>“In this swap you will create 1 matchbox for 1 partner based on one of their favorite books. Use the 32-count size</em> [free template ] <em>and make the outside of the matchbox look like the book – it doesn’t have to look like the actual cover (unless you are really creative, that would be awesome!) but it does have to look like a book. It must have the title of the book you choose. Fill the inside with items that relate to the book. For instance (I’m just using this as an example because it’s so well known) for</em> Twilight <em>you could put in a tiny fang, something to represent blood drops, an apple bead for the cover? Try to find at least 3-5 items that represent the book. You can make them if you wish. If you can’t fill the matchbox up with those things, add some brads and buttons and ribbon, etc in the color scheme and fill it to the brim!”</em></p>

<p>To join the , you must have completed at least five previous craft swaps and have no 1 or 3 ratings. You also need to have a healthy listing of favorite books on your profile page so that your sending partner will know what type of matchbox to create.</p>

<p>The swap is international and you must get signed up before October 15th. I think this swap is such a fun and unique idea! I am going to get signed up right now…</p>

Halloween-themed can be anything from ghosts and goblins to fall leaves to witches and monsters… really anything that reminds you of Halloween is fair game! Like always, you can download my free matchbox template PDFs . Anyone and everyone who enjoys Halloween is invited to come sign up before October 11th!</p>

<p>Here is an example of a matchbox I made for a similar swap in the past:</p>

This week’s swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/43330">teeny tiny stuffie swap #4</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Carotte">Carotte</a>. I can’t believe there have been three previous version of this swap that I missed!</p>

<p>For the swap, you send one miniature stuffie (“It can be sewn, felted, crocheted… if it’s small and ‘soft’ it should be ok”) to one partner. The theme is open, but checking out your partner’s profile is always cool. More info from the swap description: “Note that the final stuffie is going to be quite small, so work with care and minutia, and maybe do a test run before joining the swap if you are not sure you can make it. They can use a really small amount of fabric/felt.” The swap is international, but you must have a 4.9 overall rating, or higher, to participate. Be sure to sign up before the deadline on August 29th!</p>

<p>For some inspiration, Carotte has some wonderful examples of super-tiny stuffies on her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carotte/3682147945/">Flickr</a>. (I am in love with the little rain cloud!)</p>

<p>This week’s featured swap is a postcard swap with an intriguing twist. Coordinator, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:carol">carol</a>, has based her <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/42306">Postcard Biography Swap</a> on the art/writing project of <a href="http://www.michael-kimball.com/about.html">Michael Kimball</a>. Kimball writes the entire life stories of individuals (strangers who contact him through his blog) on 4 x 6 postcards, in under 600 words. You can learn more about his project on his <a href="http://www.michael-kimball.com/blog.php">blog</a> and by reading the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106749299">NPR story about him</a>.</p>

<p>For the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/42306">Postcard Biography Swap</a> you will write your own life story (in about 300 words) on postcards and send them to your three partners. From the swap description: <em>“Please don’t just write boring details (although you can include them too), but give us a glimpse into you. What makes you tick? What’s important in your world? Who or what shaped who you are? How?”</em></p>

<p>The swap is international and open to new users, but you must sign up NOW – the sign up deadline is August 15th! I have signed up and I can’t wait to start working on my own mini life story!</p>

<p><em>“Whether you are new to zines or a pro, this is a swap to share your unique mini-zine and also send each other your comments. This is a great way to start out if you are new to this or help each other with ideas and tips. In this swap you will create a mini-zine (1 page folded into 8 mini-pages) and send to 5 partners. Can be color or black-and-white, pics or text, whatever you like! Format is also your choice – make it unique to you!! Journal style, mini-articles, photos, recipes, news, opinions, absolutely anything goes!! Newbies are welcome, we all had to start somewhere!!”</em></p>

<p>Zines are handmade, indie magazines that are usually produced in multiple, so you will be sending copies of your single finished product to all five of your partners in the swap. The mini zine format (made from a single sheet of 8.5 x 11 inch paper) is a great way to try out making zines without requiring a huge commitment or a huge amount of content. There are some great mini zine tutorial videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh1W15BWCUk">here</a> and <a href="http://www.knowledgeup.com/2007/11/05/diy-mini-8-page-pocket-zine/">here</a> to help get you started. Have fun expressing yourself in zine form!</p>

		<p>This week’s featured swap is for those of you who consider writing an art form, a creative endeavor, a craft, or all three! The swap is <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/39817">Writing From Life</a> hosted by Swap-bot user, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:junemoon">junemoon</a>. I really like how junemoon describes the swap, so I am going to quote from the swap’s description:</p>

<p>_“Artists draw live models and go outside to paint landscapes even if they are going to become abstract artists. Writers need to write from life no matter what kind of writing they hope to do. This is a life-writing exercise. Here’s what you do…&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Take a notebook and pen and go to a place where you will see people you don’t know. Spent at least 15 minutes, more if you like, writing about the people you see, describing them as well as you can in the time they are visible. Go home and think a bit about the people you’ve written about, maybe make more notes about them.</p>

<p>Write a short story about two of the people you described. The story will start this way: they are sitting side by side on a long plane ride. One says to the other, ‘May I tell you…’ What is the story or secret? How does the other react? Or, what if the second person says, ‘No’? Don’t quit writing if s/he does, tell us what goes through both people’s minds. Does the first tell the story anyway? Does the second get curious and ask to hear? Make our story at least two double spaced pages, longer if you want.”&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>What a great writing prompt! It sounds like a fantastic way to get your creative juices flowing, even if you don’t consider yourself a writer!</p>

<p>The swap is open for sign up through July 10th, and then you have a month to complete your story and get in mailed out to your partner. The swap is international, but you must have a high rating with no flaking. Remember to read the full <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/39817">swap description</a> before committing to the swap. Happy writing!</p>

I have been drawn to the cupcake-themed swaps I’ve seen around the ‘bot lately, but I always feel like I need just a tiny bit more wiggle room on the theme…. so…. I created this simple, fun, cute dessert matchbox swap. For the swap, you simply create or decorate one 32-count matchbox (2 x 1.5 x .5 inches) in any way that has to do with dessert, and fill it full of tiny dessert-themed items. You can include cute kawaii-style food goodies, but the swap is not limited to kawaii. Any dessert is fair game: cake, candy, ice cream, cupcakes, pie, fruit, mil</p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://howtowinaguy.com/" title="tips on how to make him fall in love with you">tips on how to make him fall in love with you</a>
</div>

<p>kshakes, cookies, popsicles… any dessert you can dream of! I know it can be hard to find enough items of a specific theme to completely fill a matchbox, so there can be some freedom on what you include inside the matchbox. If some things simply follow a candy-coated color theme, that is fine by me. Just think delicious and cute!</p>

<p>If you want to create your matchbox from scratch, I have two free downloadable PDF templates that you can use <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/03/03/tuesday-tip-rachels-matchbox-template/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/06/09/tues-tip-envelope-style-matchbox-template/">here</a>. You can also view lots of examples of matchboxes on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/sets/72157602135475903/">Flickr Swap-bot set</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/38941">Cute Dessert Matchbox Swap</a> is international and all participants must have over a 4.8 rating with a strong swap record. Each swapper only has one partner and you must get signed up before July 4th. Come swap with me!!</p>

This week’s featured swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/38391">magic yarn ball SUMMER swap</a></p>

<p>hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:honeybknits">honeybknits</a> .</p>

<p>What is a magic yarn ball? It is a skein of yarn wrapped into a ball around tiny treasures like candy, stitch markers, trinkets, etc. As your partner uses the yarn in their knitting or crochet project, the little presents will fall out for them to enjoy! The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/38391">magic yarn ball SUMMER swap</a> obviously has a summer theme. All of the trinkets and treasures contained in your yarn ball should have some connection to summer. The swap is international and you have until June 19th to sign up, but be sure to read the full swap description. There is a short list of questions on the swap page that each participant must answer in order to participate. Happy swapping!</p>

The swap is a fun and simple way to honor your dad by sharing a few of the things he taught you. From the swap description:</p>

<p><em>For many, much of who we are is shaped by the things our parents told us when we were children. This is about Dear Old Dad. My dad told me to be kind if I wanted to keep friends or a husband, to apologize when I was wrong, to hold the paintbrush like a man!, to…but wait for the postcard! Let’s share the important things our fathers told us that have in some way shaped our lives, in honor of Father’s Day on June 21. In this swap you will have three partners. Send 1 postcard to each. Postcards can be any image that in some way relates to fatherhood or the home or childhood.</em></p>

		<p>I really wish there was a picture to go along with this week’s featured swap, because when I read the title I literally shrieked out loud! The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/34799">Matchbox Backpack on a Dotee swap</a>, hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Charrley">Charrley</a>, sounds like it will be a ton of adorable fun. For the swap, each participant creates a Dotee Doll of any theme for their one partner. They then alter a 32-count matchbox to be a tiny backpack for the doll. The “backpack” must contain at least five craft items that the recipient can use in future projects. The swap is international and you must sign up before May 24th.</p>

<p>Dotee Dolls are small fabric dolls created by Dorothy “Dot” Christian. They are meant to spread friendship, love, and joy.

		<p>This week’s featured swap, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/35162">Fill an Envelope Full of Crafty Supplies</a>, was chosen in honor of Earth Day. The swap, hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cittylou">cittylou</a> , is quite simple – fill an envelope full of crafty odds &amp; ends for your partner – but it helps us give new life to craft supplies and doodads that might otherwise be languishing in our craft stash. Now is the time to recycle and use all of our crafty resources efficiently!!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/35162">The swap details</a>: You must fill an A5-size envelope (21cm x 15cm or 9.5 by 6 inches) with at least five different types of craft items. Items can include yarns, ribbons, buttons, embroidery thread, felt, fabrics, patterned papers, stickers, embellishments, etc… From the swap description: “The package should be of a reasonable size and filled full of craft goodies, and above all must contain a high quality selection of goodies. It would be worth reading people’s wishlists to try and give them some things they would really like.” The swap is international and does not accept new users.</p>

A “skinny” is like an Artist Trading Card except that it’s bigger – it measures 3″ by 5″. The cards can be decorated using various techniques and media – just like ATCs. (I have added skinny to the new <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/swap-craft-term-glossary/">Swap &amp; Craft Term Glossary</a>!) <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/32189">What’s the SKINNY?!</a> is the first swap (that I know of) for skinny cards on Swap-bot. The swap, hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:graydragon">graydragon</a> is international and it is open for sign up through the last day of March. Each participant has only one partner for whom they make one skinny card of any theme or style. You must have a 4.7 rating and a full profile to participate.</p>

<p>Skinny cards seem like great collectible crafts for artists who need a little more room than an ATC provides. For more information and inspiration check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/skinnycards/">Skinny Cards Flickr</a> group.</p>

		<p>Artist Trading Cards (ATCs) are still one of the most popular swap categories on Swap-bot, and there are always new themes popping up. This week we are featuring the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/30817">Steampunk ATCs swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KatarinaNavane">KatarinaNavane</a>. But, what is steampunk?</p>

<p>“Think of what someone in the Victorian era would’ve thought the future would be like–airship filled skies, fantastic gagets running on steam and clockwork…. So a Steampunk ATC might have some Victorian elements, some more modern ones, some technological. Have fun with this. People define “steampunk” for themselves to a certain extent, so don’t get too nitpicky about it. Take the aesthetic and run with it!”</p>

New users with full profiles are welcome. For the swap you send one ATC to each of your two partners for a total of two ATCs. The sign up deadline for the swap is February 28th. Make sure to read the full swap description before signing up.</p>

		<p>Despite the poor economic climate, swapping can still be affordable and lots of fun! This week’s featured swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/26897">No-Spending Swap III</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Banshee">Banshee</a>. For this swap, each participant sends their one partner items that they already have on hand. From the swap description:</p>

<p><em>“For swappers who are low on cash or have a growing stash of nice but unused/not-needed swap items. The objective of this swap is to not spend any money to buy items for the swap, but to send items you already have. What to send? You will send at least 3 items, worth about US$5, to your swap partner. Examples of swap items can be, but not limited to, embroidery floss, fat quarters, assorted teas, stationery, postcards, stickers, etc.”</em></p>

<p>The sign up deadline for this <strong>international</strong> swap is February 5th and new users are welcome to participate if they have a full profile. The send deadline for the No-Spending Swap III is February 14th. This swap is a great reminder that we still have valuable things to share even during a recession!</p>

		<p>I am sure that many of you are busy celebrating holidays this week with your families, so I have chosen a less intensive, quick, and easy swap to feature this week: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/25658">FIRSTS of the New Year Letter/Postcard swap</a>. The requirements of the swap, hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:iamjenii">iamjenii</a>, are to send a letter or postcard to your partner describing your “firsts of the year.” From the swap description:</p>

<p>“In Japan, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_New_Year#Hatsum.C5.8Dde.2C_hatsuhinode.2C_the_.22firsts.22_of_the_year">the firsts of the new year are important</a>! So let’s share with each other what the firsts of our new years are. Your first movie, outing, detail somethings (positive please!) of your new year to share! Please write your firsts in the form of a letter OR a postcard. Also, you can include ticket stubs. photos or whatever you want. This is a simple swap to share with each other some of each others’ lives 😀 I know, so cheezy.”</p>

<p>The swap is international and you must have over a 4.7 rating to join. Each participant only sends to one partner (which makes this swap super quick and easy). A great simple swap to tackle in the new year after all the holiday craziness is done! &lt;/div&gt;</p>

Inchies are tiny (1 inch by 1 inch) artworks. They are a little like artist trading cards and they can be made out of fabric or paper. You can create your inchies using collage, painting, drawing, or any other medium or technique you enjoy!

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/26016">New Year’s Resolution Inchies swap</a> calls for some creative art making: “Each person will have two partners. For each of those partners you will create four inchies. These inchies will express your resolutions and wishes for 2009. You may choose to write the resolution in words, use a picture, draw, create a symbol or any other way to express your resolutions in the 1″ x 1″ space.”</p>

<p>The sign up deadline for this international swap is December 14th, and you must have your inchies sent by December 20th. New users are welcome with a filled out profile. If you are interested in this creative swap, start thinking about and planning your inchies now so that you can complete them within the quick turn-around time! <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/26016">Click here to sign up!</a></p>

The holiday season is upon us and it is a time for fun and for giving. Why not participate in a fun swap while also helping out others in need?

From the swap description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is a bit of an unorthodox swap – for people who like to browse online and find gifts, and for those who need some gift inspiration. In this swap, each person will post some stats about 2 recipients for whom she needs gift ideas. You will look at your partner’s comment and come up with gift ideas for her…. Find online links to examples of at least 5 of your gift ideas for each recipient. Compile all this into an email, and send it to your partner!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The swap requires a rating of 4.7, or higher, with no no-sends within the last three months. You must also have completed at least one previous swap in order to participate. IMPORTANT: This swap sign up closes on <strong>November 20th</strong> . That is this Thursday, so if you are interested you should <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/24924">go sign up now</a> ! Make sure to read the full swap description. Your gift ideas must be mailed by December 5th.</p>

<p>We all need holiday gift ideas for our hard-to-buy-for friends and family. Why not let your fellow swappers help you out?!</p>

If you like making matchboxes, and you are looking forward to the winter holiday season, the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/24920">christmas (fun) time matchbox swap – ROUND 2</a> (hosted by me, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">racheljohnson</a> ) is perfect for you! The swap is <strong>international</strong> and it is open for signup through November 30th. Each participant has just one partner to whom they send one decorated and filled matchbox. The theme, of course, is the holiday season, but any winter-type themes would also work. I like filling my boxes with stickers, ribbon, brads, buttons, beads, and other little embellishments. Anything goes. However, you must be open to receiving Christmas or winter holiday items in the mail if you join this swap.</p>

<p>Each participant must have above a 4.7 rating to join. New users are welcome, but I must ban anyone who looks fishy. (A filled out profile is always a plus.) It is a harsh world out there and I want to keep my Christmas fun time swappers safe!</p>

<p>This should be a really fun swap and I can’t wait to get started on my matchbox!</p>

<p>p.s. i angel my matchbox swaps!</p>

<p>This week’s featured swap is an annual independent swap that is being hosted on Swap-bot for the first time. Previously, the <a href="http://freshlyblended.blogspot.com/">freshly{blended}</a> and <a href="http://cakeandpie.typepad.com/">cake &amp; pie</a> <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/24124">Holiday Ornament Swap</a> (now in its third year) has had hundreds of participants. This year they have made it a public swap on Swap-bot, so any Swap-bot members can participate. The swap is international and each participant will send handmade holiday ornaments to ten partners. Here are some of the directions from the swap’s description:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design a handmade ornament that you can create multiples of and make your ornaments.</li>
  <li>Package your ornaments well…especially if you create anything fragile.</li>
  <li>Send one of your ornaments to each person on the list of 8-10 other swap participants in your group by December 10th.</li>
  <li>Sit back, relax and wait as you receive 8-10 fabulous handcrafted ornaments in the mail!</li>
</ul>

<p>This swap is a great way to meet lots of new Swap-bot members, as many of the participants already signed up are new to the site. Established Swap-bot members would be a great addition to the group to help show how our site works. Make sure to read the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/24124">entire swap description before signing up</a>. Have fun &amp; happy swapping!</p>

<p>This week we are featuring a swap which could lead to a life-long friendship: the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/23699">“In Pursuit of the Perfect Pen Pal” swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:quietlyquirky">quietlyquirky</a> . If you are a lover of letters, or an avid writer who is looking for a penpal, this swap is for you! For the swap you will have five partners, to whom you will send each a letter describing what you are looking for in a penpal. The high number of partners provides a better chance of finding a great penpal match.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you love having pen pals, but have been frustrated with the frequency or quality of the letters you’ve received in the past? Or perhaps you really would like to establish a true postal friendship with someone you jive with, but you haven’t quite been able to find that special person yet. Or maybe you’d just like to have a loyal swap partner who shares your love of a certain craft. Well, here’s where I hope this swap will assist you in finding the “perfect” pen pal!</p>

  <p>Send each of your partners a letter; it can be typed or handwritten, whichever you prefer and use most often. Introduce yourself thoroughly, and then write about what you are looking for in a pen pal. The key here is to be clear and descriptive… For example: If you don’t want to be pen pals with someone who only writes once every 6 months, say that. If you’re looking for someone who loves to read and discuss books, say that.</p>

  <p>Some ideas of things to include in your letter:</p>

  <p>frequency – will you write once a week, once a month, etc.</p>

  <p>style – do you prefer handwritten letters, typed, or both</p>

  <p>swap – would you rather just exchange letters, or would you like to do an occasional swap</p>

  <p>beliefs – if you’d like to share beliefs/politics/etc. with your pal, or if those do not matter to you in a friend</p>

  <p>age – if you’d rather write to someone close to your own age, say so, or state an age range</p>

  <p>lifestyle – moms looking for other moms, dog lovers looking for other dog lovers, health nuts looking for other health nuts, etc.</p>

  <p>hobbies/crafts – if you’d like to have a pal who shares your love of a specific hobby or craft</p>

  <p>rather-nots – whatever you’d “rather not” have <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The swap is open to USA residents with a 4.5 rating, or higher. New users with a full profile are allowed. The swap is only open for sign up through October 31st, so act quickly if you would like to join. Your letters must be sent by November 21st, 2008. Make sure to read the full swap description before signing up. Happy swapping!</p>

		<p><em>(I was out of town last week and could not keep up with the ol’ Swap-bot blog. I hope you are not suffering from swap-of-the-week withdrawal!)</em></p>

<p>For this week I have chosen to feature the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/8981">Ghost of Christmas letter swap</a>, hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=7973">Chickpea</a> <strong style="display:none"><a href="http://www.mettsalat.de/?the_game">The Game psp</a></strong> . I don’t think I have ever featured a letter swap before and this one is quite creative.</p>

<p>For the swap you are assigned two partners, to whom you must send a letter detailing things you might see if you were visited by the three ghosts from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol"><em>A Christmas Carol</em></a>. The three things you must write about are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The past. Tell your partner about a past Christmas. Did you receive the Easy Bake Oven for which you were longing? Or did something sad, surprising, or magical happen?</li>
</ul>
<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://howtoogetyourexback.com/" title="how to get your ex back">how to get your ex back</a>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>The present. What are you doing this holiday season? Are you making an extra special gift for a friend or family member? What’s going on now to make this holiday stand out?</li>
  <li>The future. What would be your dream Christmas? Would it be a Mini Coop in the driveway or two tickets to Japan? Or would the dream Christmas mean that you wouldn’t have to travel at all, and you could avoid the hustle and bustle of the airports and freeways?</li>
</ul>

<p>What a nice way to share your Christmas memories and traditions and to learn about Christmases from all around the world! Your letters should be at least two pages long, and handwritten if possible. This is an <strong>international</strong> swap. You must have a <strong>4.7</strong> <u style="display:none">[Abilene Town buy](http://utero.pe/?abilene_town)</u> rating to participate. Newbies are welcome as long as they have a filled out profile.</p>

<p>Come join the best swap ever! (Ok, I may be a little biased since I am the one hosting this swap…) If you like making matchboxes, and you are looking forward to the winter holiday season, the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/8173">Christmas (fun) Time Matchbox Swap</a> is perfect for you! The swap is international and it is open for signup through November 16th. Each participant has just one partner to whom they send one decorated and filled matchbox. The theme, of course, is the Christmas holiday, but any winter-type themes would also work. However, you must be open to receiving Christmas items in the mail. Each participant must have above a 4.6 rating to join. I am allowing a few new users, but they have all checked with me before joining. I will ban anyone who looks questionable. (BREAKING NEWS: I plan to make a good number of extra Christmas matchboxes and I will angel for this swap starting two weeks after the mail deadline. That should still give enough time for matchboxes to arrive before Christmas.)</p>

<p>Another ATC swap for this week. I chose the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/8382">Sharpie ATC swap</a>, hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=8120">ClareyFairy</a> <em style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?the_italian_job">The Italian Job film</a></em> , because I love <a href="http://www.sharpie.com/enUS/Home/default.html">Sharpies</a> and I am always interested in spreading the word about how great they are for all sorts of projects. They come in every color, including metallics and white, and they write on just about any surface.</p>

<p style="display:none">
  <a href="http://www.ryankuder.com/?law_abiding_citizen">Law Abiding Citizen divx</a>

<p>you make two ATCs for each of your two partners, for a total of four ATCs. The only medium you can use on the cards is Sharpie markers. The swap is open for signup through November 10th. You must have a 4.6 rating to join. New users and other can message <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=8120">ClareyFairy</a> for exceptions.</p>

<p>You all know that Artist Trading Card swaps are popular, but this one has a bit of a twist. The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6936">With One Palette: Harvest Colors</a> swap was created and coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2617">linpengierhody</a> (who, btw, has 104 hearts!). You have three partners in the swap, to whom you send one ATC each. “You will use ONLY Orange/Brown/Red/Yellow (although a little bit of white or black in addition to the 4 colors is acceptable if it’s part of a piece you are adding to the card).” The twist is that even though you will use harvest colors, the cards canNOT have a harvest theme. No Thanksgiving imagery!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6936">With One Palette: Harvest Colors</a></p>

<p>is open for sign up through October 31st (Halloween!) and items must be sent out by November 12th. You must have a 4.85 rating to participate. If you are new, message <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2617">linpengierhody</a> <strong style="display:none"><a href="http://www.turtlesurvival.org/?from_within">From Within rip</a></strong> with information about yourself.</p>

<p>Have fun exploring harvest colors!</p>

<p>This week I have chosen the](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/7929)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have a favorite Thanksgiving recipe or recipes that were handed down from your Family? How about new Family recipes that you make every Thanksgiving? Maybe there are new recipes that you have tried and decided they are going to be featured at the Thanksgiving dinner table? This swap is for tried and true family recipes that were handed down to you, or ones that you hope to hand down to future generations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To honor the individual whose recipes you are using please send your partners one usable kitchen item that represents the person and the recipe in some way. You could send a beautiful wooden spoon, a cool spatula, a lovely potholder, etc. Please include a note telling your partner about your inherited or found recipes and why you chose the item and how it relates to your recipes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This swap is USA-only because it is in celebration of the US Thanksgiving holiday. It is open to “committed quality swappers only” with zero no sends. New users are not allowed. Each person has two partners to whom they send at least one recipe on a standard size recipe card and one quality usable new kitchen item. Signup closes October 20th.</p>

<p>The best thing about this fun recipe swap is that it is that the send date is early enough (November 1st) that you will get your new recipes in time to try them out on Thanksgiving! Yum!</p>

		<p>By now, most of us are totally familiar with Artist Trading Cards, but <strong>Inchie Art</strong> may be something new and unfamiliar. Inchies are a lot like ATCs, but much smaller – only one inch by one inch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=6662">Beckra</a></p>

<p>is hosting the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/7848">Recycled Inchie Art swap</a> for anyone wanting to explore the art of collage on a small scale while using recycled materials. She describes the swap requirements this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make 6 separate 1-inch art-squares for 2 partners (12 inchies total), using paper products which were destined for the recycling bin or trash. You could cut up thin cardboard boxes for backing, collage with junk mail, incorporate pieces of funky designs used for security envelopes–these are just examples; in general, you can follow your own inclinations and inspirations as lo</p>

</div>

  <p>ng as you send each partner 6 individual squares using materials that would otherwise have gone by the wayside!&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

  <p>The swap is open to all all swappers, including international, with a rating of at least a 4.8. Newbies are welcome as long as they have a completed profile. The last day to sign up is October 10th.</p>

  <p>Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It’s fun to be a vampire.&lt;/p&gt;
That is the tagline from the 1987 teen horror movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437/"><em>The Lost Boys</em></a>. It is about a group of young boys who bring down a wild vampire gang and it used to be one of my favorite movies (next to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093560/"><em>The Monster Squad</em></a>) to watch around Halloween time. The movie starred Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, and a young Kiefer Sutherland.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Make sure to read the entire <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6908">swap description</a> before signing up.

The swap was created by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=7386">Liz Z.</a> and it is open for sign up through September 28th. The swap is simple: just send your one partner items to make housework more fun. Things like music, nice cleaning supplies, a list of house cleaning tips and tricks, or a reward for when the cleaning is done are all items you could include. Spend at least $5 and put everything</p>

<p>I am always on the look-out for unique swaps to feature… the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6794">Camera and Flat Shirley Swap</a> definitely meets that criteria. The swap is hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2991">funkychicken</a> and it is a somewhat complicated two-step swap, so please read the entire swap description before signing up.</p>

<p>Basically, each participant creates a “flat shirley” of themselves – a small paper body with a picture of themselves for its head, based loosely on the &lt;a h</p>

<div style="display: none">
  ex gf <a href="http://exbacksms.com/">exbacksms.com</a> How to win back your ex
</div>

<p>ref=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060097914/susanreynolar-20″&gt;Flat Stanley books&lt;/a&gt; – and sends it along with a disposable camera to their partner. The flat shirley stays with the partner for a month and travels around with the person getting its photo taken in various locations. When the month is up, the partner sends back the full camera and flat shirley back to the original creator. This swap should make for some funny and surprising photos of each little “mini me”!</p>

<p>The swap is international, but requires a 4.7 rating or higher. There are more guidelines and detailed information on the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6794">swap’s home page</a></p>

<p>. Happy swapping!</p>

		<p>This week we are featuring a very unique and clever swap hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=7606">spoonergregory</a> <strong style="display:none"><a href="http://www.barryshamis.com/?banshee_">Banshee!!! psp</a></strong> called <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6020">Art from Start to Finish</a>. This extremely creative international swap is open to experienced participants who have over a 4.5 rating. The purpose of the swap is to “find out about the process that other people go through when they make a piece of original artwork.” For the swap you create one original piece of artwork (any medium except photography or ATCs) and document the entire process. Each participant will send their one partner the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The piece of original artwork created for this swap.&lt;/a&gt;
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A letter explaining your creative process. This can be t &lt;div style="display: none"&gt;
  <a href="http://capturehislove.com/" title="relationship advice">relationship advice</a>
&lt;/div&gt;</p>

        <p>yped or handwritten, but must be at least two pages.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A photograph of the materials you used.</li>
          <li>A photograph of your work space.</li>
          <li>At least three photographs of the work at various stages of completion.</li>
          <li>Your early sketches/photographs/ideas that you used as inspiration for the finished piece&lt;/ul&gt;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As you can see, this is a very involved swap, but it would be absolutely fascinating to get an inside look into other artists’ creative processes and to show off your own work! <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6020">Art from Start to Finish</a> is open for sign up through the 30th of August. After that you have a full month (until October 1st) to create and document your art. Please see the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6020">swap’s info page</a> for the complete requirements. Good luck and happy swapping!</p>

		<p>After a 2.5 month hiatus, weekly featured swaps are back! There are so many great swaps to choose from (577 open swaps right now!) it was hard to pick just one…</p>

<p>This week’s featured swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/5970">Fiber Art Photography ATC Swap</a> hosted by &lt;a href=http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=9056”&gt;fiberfool&lt;/a&gt;. The swap is open for signup through the end of August, and your ATCs must be mailed to your three partners by September 14th. The swap is international and open to any swapper with a 4.5 rating or higher. Each participant will send three ATCs to each of their partners. &lt;img class=”alignright” src=&amp;#</p>

<p>ATCs are a very popular swap item, but despite their popularity I still get many emails asking what they are. ATCs are Artist Trading Cards. They are 2.5 x 3.5 inches in size, are created by hand, and are either one-of-a-kind or in limited editions. For those of you who are new to them, here are a few links to ATC sites:</p>

I love her magazines the most (Weddings is just awesome!) and her new <a href="http://www.marthastewartcrafts.com/index.php?v=msc_products&amp;sort=-price&amp;DCMP=KNC-G-MS_Crafts&amp;pa=netramind&amp;HBX_OU=50&amp;HBX_PK=martha%20stewart%20craft">craft line</a> at Michaels is great. Because of my love for all things Martha, I couldn’t pass up the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3984">Martha Stewart 101 swap</a> for this week’s featured swap. Here is the description from the swap page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This swap is for those that really enjoy Martha Stewarts creations from her t.v show, magazines and her online site. This swap requires you to send out a Martha Stewart inspired item, store bought or made or you can even send a kit with instructions to how to make something. Please send nice items out, nobody wants to get junk they will just end up trashing. You will have 1 partner and please try to make the swap $8-$10 before postage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must have a rating above 4.5 with a filled out profile in order to participate in this swap. I believe the swap is international, but you should check with the coordinator, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=63">LadyYing</a>, to make sure. Also, the swap closes for sign-up on June 1st, so act quickly if you would like to participate!</p>

		<p>One of my favorite things about Swap-bot is that it has inspired me to try out new crafts (did anyone say matchboxes?), so this week I chose to feature a swap that is based on that exact premise: the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3508">Mini DIY Craft Kits Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=5085">Origami Grace</a>. Each participant only has one partner in this swap, to whom they will send a craft kit of their own creation. From the swap description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will assemble (or buy) a small kit that will provide all materials and instructions needed for your partner to make one or two complete items: for example – two ATCs, two handmade notecards, one mini scrapbook or sticky pad book, one crocheted bookworm or hairband, one mini cross-stitch kit or other embroidery, one pair of beaded earrings, one pendant, one jeweled pin or broach, one bracelet, one mini picture frame, one refrigerator magnet, one altered altoid tin, one matchbox shrine, etc. Omit glue, scissors, tape – I’m gonna assume we all have that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please also note that this is a US only swap and it has a high rating requirement (4.7). The signup deadline is May 15th. If you like the idea of this swap, there is also the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3519">Craft Kit Swap</a> and the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3622">ATC DIY Kits Swap</a>. Check them out!</p>

<p>For inspiration I found a few links to DIY kits you can purchase on the internet. (I believe that for the swaps you are technically supposed to create the kits yourself, but I thought we could get ideas from some of the cool craft kits out there.) Below you will see the <a href="http://www.sublimestitching.com/lapetite.html">La Petite Embroidery Kit</a> from Sublime Stitching and the <a href="http://www.paper-source.com/cgi-bin/paper/4071291601.html?cm_id=2950.070">Candy Shop Magnolia Paper Flower Kit</a> from Paper Source. I also love this <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=5902145">Cup O’ Joe Pincushion Kit</a></p>

<p>by betzwhite and this <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=5829147">Needle Felting Kit</a> by madebymoxie, both on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/index.php">Etsy</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, if you have ever checked out my <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/">personal blog</a>, you know that I am a sucker for the pastel colors. Because of that fact, I couldn’t resist choosing the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3396">Ice Cream Colors Matchbox Swap</a> for this week’s featured swap. I completed my fist matchbox swap a week ago and my little matchbox is on its way to Australia. I can’t wait to start on my next one!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3396">Ice Cream Colors Matchbox Swap</a> is coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=5464">ellawitch</a>. Here are the rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This swap is to decorate and fill a 32-count matchbox using what I call “Ice Cream Colors”. The matchbox and it’s contents must be done in chocolate brown and one of the following colors: light pink, mint, light yellow, light blue, aqua or lavender. You can do more than a two color combination but it has to be chocolate brown and at least one of the other colors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This swap is international, but there are some other rules and restrictions, so make sure you read the entire description before signing up. People fill their matchboxes with all sorts of things, including buttons, beads, brads, stickers, sequins, pins, ribbon, candies, little embellishments, etc… anything miniature and cute is acceptable! <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>I know that I can’t wait to start putting together my ice creamy matchbox, but in case you need some inspiration, here is some delicious ice cream for you:</p>

		<p>Ok. You caught me. I missed last week’s featured swap… sorry. We are back in action this week with a fun featured swap: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3029">Make Me Smile</a>. The swap is all about making yourself and your partners happy! It is coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=6587">lindalinda</a> and it is open for sign up through April 30th. It is an international swap with three partners and three parts. Following is the swap’s description of the three things you send to each partner:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put together a mix cd of about 15-20 tracks that make you smile. Might include sugary-sweet 50s pop, anything with smile-worthy lyrics, songs that bring back happy memories, a recording of a favorite comedian, maybe even a silly song you listened to as a child. Whatever works for you. Please don’t include more than 2 songs by a single artist. Be sure to include a track listing sheet. You might even want to write descriptions about why some of the songs you chose make you happy.</li>
  <li>Make a list of 100 things that make you happy. I did this a long time ago in a writing class, and it was a real challenge, but fun and worth the effort.</li>
  <li>Include a little inexpensive surprise in the envelope that you think will make your partner smile. Could be something handmade, could be candy, could be a cute little notepad, a pen, glittery stickers, whatever.</li>
</ol>

<p>Making the list of 100 things that make you happy will be tough, but fun! I am pumped to try, anyway. How fun will it be to get three mix cds of music that is bound to make you smile?! I can’t wait!</p>

I do not have kids, and I not planning on having any for a while, but I love thinking about baby names!</p>

<p>The Baby Names swap is coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=6934">Jellybaby</a> and it is an international swap. Each participant has four partners to whom they send their list of top ten girl names and top ten boy names. A quick and easy swap, but make sure you read all of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2845">instructions</a> before signing up. This swap would be great for expecting parents who haven’t picked out a name, yet!</p>

<p>This week’s featured swap is the &lt;a href=http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2327”&gt;Fabric Art Charms Swap&lt;/a&gt; coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2991">funkychickenoriginals</a>. Yes, funkychickenoriginals was also the coordinator of last week’s featured swap. I did not mean to pick the same host twice, but this swap just looked so original I couldn’t pass it up. In the future, I will be sure to spread the coordinator love around a bit more…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2327"><img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/swap3.jpg" alt="swap3.jpg" /></a><a href="http://cqmagonline.com/vol06iss01/articles/645/index.shtml"><img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/artcharms.jpg" alt="artcharms.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Anyhoo, the Fabric Art Charms Swap is all about swapping a fun new art item: fabric charms. Each swap participant has only one partner to send to, but they must send twelve fabric charms. It is an international swap, but please read all of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2327">swap details</a> before signing up. The swap is open for signup through April 1st.</p>

<p><a href="http://ruthrae.blogspot.com/2006/12/fabric-charms.html"><img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/317277630_3e9b459440.jpg" alt="317277630_3e9b459440.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>So, what exactly is a fabric art charm? Fabric art charms are 1″ squares of fabric and fibers that are stitched around all of the edges. They can include beads, buttons, or other embellishments, and they often include a grommet so that the charms can be attached to jewelry. They can also be called fabric collage charms or fiber art charms.</p>

<p>More information about fabric art charms can be found on these sites:</p>

The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2582">Mail Art Swap</a>, organized by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2991">funkychickenoriginals</a>, is all about being creative and making mail beautiful. Each member of the swap has five partners to whom they send one piece of mail art. Mail art can be anything from a handmade postcard to a decorated envelope, or even a lovely letter, zine, or newsletter. The swap homepage says this about mail art:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mail art is art which uses the postal system as a medium. The term “mail art” can refer to an individual message, the medium through which it is sent, and an art movement.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For more information about mail art, check out the following sites:</p>

</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2582">Mail Art Swap</a> is open for signup through March 28th. This would be a great swap for collage artists, computer designers, painters, or anyone who would like to send something fun through the mail. This swap could also be a great opportunity to challenge yourself and try a new type of craft or art style. New swappers are welcome, but please check all of the parameters on the swap homepage for more details. Happy swapping!</p>

ATC stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist_trading_cards">Artist Trading Card</a>, and they are one of the most popular items being traded on <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com">Swap-bot</a> these days. I figured it was about time that an ATC swap was featured here on the blog, and then I stumbled upon this funny and clever swap: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2565">The Dating Game ATCs swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4006">wackystuff</a>. (BTW, wackystuff is a fabulous swap coordinator who has a perfect 5 rating and 10 hearts after participating in over 40 swaps! wow!) The Dating Game ATCs swap is an international swap and each swapper has two partners to which they send 3 ATCS. Here is what the swap description says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swap-bot is like a blind date, so letâ€™s make Artist Trading Cards of Bachelor #1, Bachelor #2 and Bachelor #3. These could be portraits of your ideal date or some of the less than perfect characters that have crossed your path. Make a set of 3 ATCs each for 2 swap partners. All media welcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How fun and funny! Will you send your swap partners three hunks, three nerds, three celebrities, or some combination? Be creative and make up clever descriptions for each of your bachelors. Make your partners laugh!</p>

<p>_To learn more about ATCs visit <a href="http://www.artist-trading-cards.ch/">this artist trading cards website</a>, and for examples of trading cards made by other artists check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/95067770@N00/">ATC Flickr Pool</a>.</p>

This week’s featured swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2175">Music to Craft to</a> swap coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=5486">Kimmie</a>. This swap is a great combination of crafting and music. Each swapper has three partners to whom they send original mix cds. This is a great way to show other swappers and crafters your personality and style!</p>

<p>One note about cd swapping: We have had a swapper, or two, take advantage of cd swaps (in a way). A few people have been waiting to receive cds from their “sending” partners and then they copy those mixes and send the copies to their “receiving” partners. When swappers do this some members of the swap end up getting two of the same mix. That does not make them feel happy. Mix cds are a chance to show your creativity and personality. Have fun with it!</p>

<p>I am a little late with this week’s featured swap, but I have chosen the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2328">Nature Books</a> <em style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?speed">Speed the movie</a></em> swap hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=7">Pablo</a>. The Nature Books swap is an easy one-partner swap for those nature lovers out there. It is open to join through March 15th, so you have plenty of time to find a cool nature book to swap and tell your friends to join in!</p>

<p>p.s. If you truly are a nature lover, you should check out Pablo’s blog, <a href="http://www.roundrockjournal.com/">Roundrock Journal</a>. It contains daily nature writings as well as photographs like the ones seen here.</p>

Organized by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2228">purplemorgan</a>, the Spring Apron Swap is an international swap, but you must have a rating of over 4.7. Each participant has one partner for whom they will sew one “half apron”. This is what purplemorgan says about the aprons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you noticed that aprons are making a comeback? Not the butcher/chef/BBQ style that you can find anywhere, but the more vintage-style hostess/housewife aprons. I LOVE these, and they are SO easy to sew! I’m brand new to sewing but even I can do it. Make sure you get your assigned partner’s waist measurements and add plenty of inches to make certain the strings will tie! Also, it’s always nice to add a few tuck-ins to your package. For this swap, a wooden spoon or other kitchen utensil, potholder, a few recipes or tea bags, any of these would be a lovely little tuck-in surprise for your assigned person. This isn’t required. All that is required is a simple half apron with one pocket.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might be able to figure out how to sew one of these aprons on your own if you are an experienced seamstress, but just in case you need some help here are some websites that offer patterns for the cute half aprons and a few other types:</p>

  <li>For more fun sewing aprons check out <a href="http://angrychicken.typepad.com/tieoneon/">Tie One On</a></li>

<p>Have fun sewing a vintage-y, spring-y apron! While you’re at it… make one for yourself!</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.swap-bot.com/images/swaps/2107/swap.jpg" />Matchbox swaps have been quite popular lately, and this week’s featured swap is th <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2107">SpringTime Kawaii Matchbox Swap</a> coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4510">Straycat</a>.</p>

<p>Kawaii is a certain style of cute products from Japan. And when I say cute, I mean CUTE! Check out the description of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii">Kawaii on Wikipedia</a>, or visit the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/japancute/">Japan Cute! blog</a> <u style="display:none">[Sideways film](http://utero.pe/?sideways)</u> to learn more about it. There have been previous swaps on swap-bot based around Kawaii, including previous <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/kawaiimatchboxswap/">Kawaii matchbox swaps</a>. A matchbox swap basically entails decorating a small matchbox and filling it full of little trinkets and goodies.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/144/321363428_2a1b3ded87_m.jpg" />The swap home page explains it this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simply load up a decorated matchbox with tiny kawaii items &amp; mail it to your partner! At least 1 store-bought Japanese kawaii item must be included. Handmade goods are optional &amp; adored! Please try to jam pack the little matchbox as much as possible. Springtime: Let’s welcome the new season with pretty colors &amp; cute animals! Kawaii: It means “cute” in Japanese. ie Sanrio, Q-Lia, Kamio, Lemon Co., Midori, etc. Matchbox: A cutely decorated 32-stick or a Euro matchbox is our goal, but… hehe If it’s cute &amp; tiny, it’s accepted! DIY, tiny candy boxes, or other purchased equivalents are a-okay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/101/363777794_1e6eee7130_m.jpg" />Things you might include in your matchbox: stickers, erasers, candies, paper clips, pins and buttons, tiny stationery, anything small, cute &amp; spring-y! The Springtime Kawaii Matchbox Swap is international, but it does require a 4.0 rating or higher. Matchbox swaps are a great way to express your creativity without spending a ton on supplies and postage! Happy swapping!</p>

		<p><img id="image42" class="alignleft" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/swap.jpg" alt="swap.jpg" />This week we are featuring the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2088">Themed Paint Can Swap</a> coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=3548">fairykiss</a>. Each swapper only has one partner for this unique swap, which is a good idea because of the creativity and time needed to create a themed paint can. A themed or altered paint can is simply a new, clean, one-gallon paint can that has been decorated and filled according to a specific theme. Check out these <a href="http://www.scrapjazz.com/topics/Techniques/Altered_Art/512.php">instructions</a> for step by step directions on how to make one.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2088">Themed Paint Can Swap</a> is open until February 17th for signup. Participants then have over a month to check out their partner’s profile and decorate and fill a lovely paint can that matches their personality. There is a $10 <strong>minimum</strong> for the things you put inside the paint can. This swap is US only.</p>

<p><img id="image44" class="alignleft" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/beachcan.jpg" alt="beachcan.jpg" />Some themed paint can ideas: If your partner’s favorite colors happened to be pink and yellow, you could create a spring-themed paint can filled with spring stickers and stationery, flower seeds, lemon drops, sunglasses, etc… A spa-themed paint can filled with pampering goodies like bubble bath and nail polish would also be fun. Or, if your partner likes scrapbooking, a paint can filled with fun scrapbooking embellishments and tools would be sure to please! A single favorite color, or two, could also be interpreted as a theme.</p>

<p>This fun swap really gets your imagination going! It is perfect for swappers who would like to put a little extra care in creating a beautiful swap package. Have fun!</p>

		<p>This is the exciting first installment of the Weekly Featured Swap! Every week we will pick a swap that we believe is a great example of an interesting, fun, and well-organized swap. We will make sure the featured swap is open for sign-up through the following week.</p>

<p><img alt="yarnball1.jpg" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/yarnball1.jpg" class="alignleft" />This week’s featured swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/1708">Magic Yarn Ball</a> swap coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4512">Katy</a>. This is a great swap for people who would love to receive (and send!) yarn that could be used in knitting or crocheting projects. The swap is marked US only and has a few other restrictions, so please read the entire description before signing up. (Also, we just implemented a new feature which allows coordinators to check over the final list of participants and ban anyone they need to before partners are assigned, so make sure you meet all of the requirements.)</p>

<p>So, what exac</p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://getyourextips.com/" title="get your ex back">get your ex back</a>
</div>

<p>tly is a magic yarn ball? Katy describes them likes this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, you wrap cool little treasures up in a ball of yarn, and give it as a gift. As the recipient crafts with the yarn the treasures fall out one by one, and they discover the fun as they knit or crochet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img alt="yarnball2.jpg" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/yarnball2.jpg" class="alignleft" />It sounds like a lot of fun! There are all sort of little trinkets and treasures you could include in your magic yarn ball for your swap partner to discover, like buttons, candy, beads, little figurines, fabric, ribbon, toys, etc… Anything small and playful that your partner will be delighted to see unraveling from their ball of yarn</p>

<p>And for those of you who live in Europe, there is a Europe-only <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/1687">Valentine Magic Yarn Ball Swap</a> coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2661">Lixie</a>. This swap is open through the end of the month, so make sure to check it out!</p>
