<p>These two frighteningly awesome Ernie creations were made for the swap. Count Ernie von Envelope (seen above) was made in glass by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:smadronia">smadronia</a>. I love the little fangs!! And the FrankenErnie plushie (seen below) was made by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:moonlightlaura">moonlightlaura</a>. Look at that detail! So cute!</p>

<p>A group of Swap-bot members from Missouri and Illinois planned a crafty meetup over the weekend. Seen above are the swappers, from left to right: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Vickyen">Vickyen</a> (Vicky Englert from Waterloo, IL), <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sammie91">sammie91</a> (Linda Bishop from St. Charles, MO), <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:hiimtm">hiimtm</a> (Tonya Bentley from Fenton, MO), and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:transplanted1">transplanted1</a> (Rachel Kaye from Columbia, MO). Seated: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Elliepatterson">Elliepatterson</a> (Ellie Patterson from O’Fallon, IL), and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cwfshoppe329">cwfshoppe329</a> (Terri McHugh from Hallsville, MO).</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/moilmeetup2.jpg" alt="moilmeetup2" width="470" height="259" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10783" /></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Vickyen">Vickyen</a> sent this report:</strong></p>

<p>_On Saturday, October 12, 2013, six Swap-Bot members got together at the Foundry Artist Centre, in St. Charles, MO. The members were from different parts of Illinois and Missouri, and had never met in person before this fun-filled event! Each member had their own type of swaps they enjoy participating in and looking at the crafting area, they brought lots of goodies to share and work on!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Terri McHugh was showing everyone how to make lovely fondant flowers. Linda Bishop brought tons of crafting supplies to share. Ellie Patterson had lovely goodie bags and techniques to share. Tonya Bentley, Rachel Kaye, and Vicky Englert also had fun sharing and learning! What a great group of gals!</p>

<p>The time at the Foundry went way too quickly and everyone agreed that we should try to do this again! Also a big Swap-Bot Thank You to Rachel Johnson for the Swap-Bot swag – everyone loved it and will think of this fun day when they use their goodies!&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/meetupflower.jpg" alt="meetupflower" width="470" height="362" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10784" /></p>

<p>It looks like a fun event… I would love to learn how to make fondant flowers someday!</p>

<p>If you meet up with other Swap-bot members, please let me know! We’d love to publish your report here on the blog. Email me photos and details at rachel -at- swap-bot.com. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Over the weekend, a group of members from the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/3ac77bf8854d7129ab893f0e1776a927/about">Swappers in Florida Group</a> got together for a day of crafting. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:turtlelady45">TurtleLady45</a> sent in this fabulous and fun report:</strong></p>

<p><em>The Swappers in Florida Group held a ‘Craft Day’ October 20 at the Ridge Clubhouse, Davenport, FL. Thanks <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Silwygurl">Silwygurl</a> for getting the room for us! Ten crafty ladies</em> [seen above are Michelle — rep for Close to My Heart, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:RyeRye">RyeRye</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Stampsnob">Stampsnob</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:turtlelady45">TurtleLady45</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Geminigirl">Geminigirl</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KitchenDiva">KitchenDiva</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Craftchallenged">Craftchallenged</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Snoop">Snoop</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Bluecrayons">Bluecrayons</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Silwygurl">Silwygurl</a>] <em>from all over Florida attended. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:turtlelady45">TurtleLady45</a> organized the day. <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/turtlelady45.jpg" alt="" title="turtlelady45" width="191" height="301" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9216" />She made name tags for both our SB and our real names, but we mostly called each other by our SB names! True to her name, Turtlelady45, wore a tee-shirt with turtles on it as well as a turtle hat!</em> [Love it!]</p>

<p>_After getting acquainted for a while, we started off the day with demos by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Snoop">Snoop</a>. She showed us how to make an Ice Card and a Black Enamel Love mask card (ATC size). <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:RyeRye">RyeRye</a> continued with a demo of the round looms found in craft stores. She was making a hat.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>We broke for a potluck lunch. Oh! What yummy foods…mac &amp; tuna salad, bean salad, pear, almond &amp; blue cheese with greens, meatballs, pork sliders, zucchini bread, brownies, and snacks.</p>

<p>Then, we had a gift bag swap. Each lady brought a gift bag with goodies in it. One by one we took a bag, but the ‘catch’ was if you liked what someone else got, you took it from them…they would get to take another bag. We all received some wonderful craft supplies.</p>

<p>After lunch, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Wickedred">Wickedred</a> gave a workshop in polymer clay. Each lady brought a package of clay and we all made turtles! Such a variety of turtles in various colors. And, Michelle, a rep from Close to My Heart, taught us how to make a corner bookmark.</p>

<p>It was a fun day. We got to put faces to names! We talked, we ate, we crafted. Swappers in Florida hope to have craft days every few months.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, a group of four Swap-botters — <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:JenHuff">JenHuff</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Conniew">ConnieW</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Lilspotteddog">Lilspotteddog</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:LauraAust">LauraAust</a> — met up in Columbus, Ohio, for some scrapbooking, crafting, and fun! (ConnieW, Lilspotteddog, and LauraAust are seen above in their crafting diva crowns. Gorgeous!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenhuff1/7832667738/in/photostream/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ohioscrappin.jpg" alt="" title="ohioscrappin" width="470" height="228" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9146" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ohioscrappin-300x145.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ohioscrappin.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>

<p>JenHuff sent the following report: “I can’t get over LauraAust driving 12 hours one way to meet up! We really did have a blast and ate wayyyyy toooooo much! It was all worth it! I’m already planning for next year.” (JenHuff and Lilspotteddog are seen below looking cute in a giant rocking chair.)</p>

<p>On October 8th 2011, four Swap-Bot members — <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:andrewlips">AndrewLips</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Kessie">Kessie</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kittenred">kittenred</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:paperbutterflywings">paperbutterflywings</a> — met up in Newcastle, England.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/UKmeetup3.jpg" alt="" title="UKmeetup3" width="200" height="269" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8548" />AndrewLips (seen to the right playing guitar) hosted the event and sent this report:</p>

<p>_“We all met at my house around midday. Everyone who came got 3 goodie bags <strong>each</strong> from each member, including Swap-Bot postcards, buttons and stickers kindly provided by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">racheljohnson</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Then we did 3 workshops:</p>

<p>I did a screen printing workshop, where we screen printed Ernie onto t-shirts and tote bags. They came out really nice. Paperbutterflywings did a workshop showing us how to make sock monsters which was incredibly cute and easy to do. After that Kessie did a workshop on bottle-cap pendants and bottle-cap magnets. Again, this was so simple, and came out looking so lovely. We all had a lot of fun doing those workshops. Then we had dinner together. Later in the evening we had a houseshow at my house, which was 5 acoustic singers playing by candle light, followed by an 80’s disco! The swap-bot members stayed at my house for the night.</p>

<p>I love the screen printed Ernie items they made!! It sounds like a fun and very creative day. Remember, I’d love to share photos and reports from any and all Swap-bot user meetups. Email me anytime at rachel -at- swap-bot.com.</p>

<p>A group of awesome Swap-botters met up on July 15th in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada to chat, craft, and have some fun.</p>

<p>(In the photo above are… Standing from left to right: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pj">PJ</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:dulcimer">Dulcimer</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CINDYAC">CindyAC</a>, friend of CindyAC, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:lepapillonvert">Lepapillonvert</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Masterbard">Masterbard</a>, friend of CindyAC, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TeePeeMaiden">TeePeemaiden</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Lostdawill">Lostdawill</a>, and kneeling from left to right: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TerryF">TerryF</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Toupti">Toupti</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:heavenscreations">Heavenscreations</a>.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heavenscreations/5944445103/in/set-72157627211398062/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ontariomeetuphosts.jpg" alt="" title="ontariomeetuphosts" width="464" height="338" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8307" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ontariomeetuphosts-300x218.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ontariomeetuphosts.jpg 464w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /></a></p>

<p>The event was organized by Lepapillonvert and TeePeemaiden. The two are seen above with the amazing cupcakes they served at the event.</p>

<p>In addition to an in-person swap, PJ (seen to the left above crafting with heavenscreations and TeePeemaiden) wrote this recap of the event:</p>

<p><em>“We made beautiful cards designed and supplied by TeePeeMaiden. Masterbard showed us how to make awesome steampunk ATC’s and shared lots of Korean paper goodies with us. lepaillonvert showed us how to make a folder envie with an old calendar page. We had more yummy snacks than we could eat. We all brought gifty goodies for each other – some people brought a lot of goodies and really wowed us. A little bit of shopping was done.”</em></p>

<p>Last Saturday, July 16th, a group of six UK swap-botters (seen above: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:denimblu14">denimblu14</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kittenred">kittenred</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:AndrewLips">AndrewLips</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Carolinev237">Carolinev237</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:AnnMarie">AnnMarie</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:hippysherree">hippysherree</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:reauk">reauk</a>) met in Sheffield for some in-person swapping and crafting. The event was organized by AndrewLips and he sent this report:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/UKmeetup2.jpg" alt="" title="UKmeetup2" width="200" height="323" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8279" />_“We met on wet a Saturday morning in a lovely pub called The Cutler in Sheffield. A small but awesome group of members came, mostly made up of Northern based swappers. When we got there, we put together some tables and everyone put on the table the items they had brought for the goodiebags (each person who came got a goodiebag). People brought so many amazing lovely handmade crafts. The goodiebags were stuffed with treats. It felt like Christmas! Even <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mum2boys82">mum2boys82</a> who could not make the swap sent treats, which was greatly appreciated by the group. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Shortly after we had our ice breaker where people showed some of their favourite swaps they had received on Swap-bot. After this kittenred did her Woolly Dolly workshop which was lots of fun as well as very simple and easy to do.&lt;/i&gt; [Denimblu14 is seen to the left with her Woolly Dolly.]</p>

<p><em>After this a few people had to leave. The rest of us stayed and had lunch together at the pub and then walked around looking at the city of Sheffield. It was so nice to meet everyone who came. We all really enjoyed ourselves. It was clear to see how much Swap-Bot means to all of us, how big a part of our lives it is. It was really nice to see the offline community it has created and put a face to the names. When it was time to leave the sun had come out which was a shame, as we did plan a picnic… Maybe next time!”</em></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/UKmeetup3.jpg" alt="" title="UKmeetup3" width="470" height="311" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8280" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/UKmeetup3-300x198.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/UKmeetup3.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>It sounds like it was a lovely afternoon! The group says that they are already planning future events. If you are a UK swapper and interested in meeting other Swap-bot members, join the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/40829ed09bd8217dd6f1488aa7b0992c/about">UK meet up group</a>!</p>

<p>Also, if you are planning a group meet-up with other Swap-bot members, please let me know in advance! (contact rachel -at- Swap-bot.com) I will send along some Swap-bot goodies.</p>

<p>Last weekend, a group of Swap-bot friends gathered in Ohio for a fun in-person meet-up. The occasion of the gathering was a visit from <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:RyeRye">RyeRye</a>, who lives in Florida and is the founder of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/a2282f05b820a8c3db28bc9351c270b2/about">Crafting Queens group</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/RyeryeLittespotted.jpg" alt="" title="RyeryeLittespotted" width="470" height="355" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8237" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/RyeryeLittespotted-300x226.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/RyeryeLittespotted.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>Swap-botters came from far and wide, including <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:lepapillonvert">lepapillonvert</a> who came down from Canada, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:dkay">dkay</a> and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pandessa">pandessa</a> who drove ten hours from New York state to get there, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MzPatti">MzPatti</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:izohgore">izohgore</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:chavve">Chavve</a> from Ohio. The two-day event was hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:lilspotteddog">lilspotteddog</a>. (RyeRye and lilspotteddog are together in the photo above – love that hat!)</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/craftgroup.jpg" alt="" title="craftgroup" width="470" height="322" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8239" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/craftgroup-300x205.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/craftgroup.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>Here is the official fun times report from lilspotteddog:</p>

<p>_People came on Friday evening and we ate BBQ pulled pork sammies, nachos, cheesecake, artery-clogging brownies made by RyeRye and topped with everything but the kichen sink, then we trundled down to my basement craft area to share things we had made and to play a little before piling into the beds around 4:00 AM. We were back up around 9:00 AM to hit the road headed off near the Cleveland/Akron area to meet up with izohgore and Chavve. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>We had lunch at the Macaroni Grill where a most generous someone picked up the entire check (wasn’t me!) and then went on to Hollo’s to browse through that paper crafters’ dream. After asking random strangers to take our pics all day, we drove home with more shopping on the way.</p>

<p>Saturday evening we had a salad bar and more desserts and traded prezzies back and forth. Without knowing we were doing that, everyone had given each other goodies. RyeRye and I had done up a little bucket with an apron, ruler, chocolate, and some little drawstring bags she found. The New Yorkers brought gorgeous packs of nice bright cardstock for all. MzPatti spoiled us all with profile themed how to books and fabric charm packs. Cat gave everyone a piece of her gorgeous artwork, and lepapillonvert brought yummy glitter-sprinkled cupcakes topped with handmade picks commemorating RyeRye’s group, the Crafting Queens. Although we did not have time for the make and take activities we had planned, everyone managed to get a little creativity going on. Lepapillon made some ATCs, RyeRye made the items for two swaps she is in, and pandessa got the journal constructed for an altered journal swap she is in.</p>

<p>I am charged with taking the cupcake pics made by lepapillon and turning them into a commemorative medallion for the occasion and then sending them off.</p>

<p>We had a blast, but the best thing was meeting the person behind the name. It has added so much more dimension to our online interactions.</p>

<p>Thanks to SB and you Rachel, for the enrichment this site has given to my life.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>It sounds like almost too much fun was had! What a great meet-up! You can read more about the fun in <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/77195">this forum thread</a>. Also, to all the attendees: please add more details in the comments! I’d love to put usernames with faces in the group photos above.</p>

<p>Do you keep a journal or diary? How about a visual diary or altered journal? Art journaling is an art form that incorporates writing, drawing, painting, collage, and scrapbooking within a bound book of some type. It is a way of expressing yourself freely and experimenting with different techniques. You can find some amazing examples of art journaling on <a href="http://pinterest.com/search/?q=art+journal">Pinterest</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%22art%20journal%22">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>User <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:spinjenny">spinjenny</a> (whose journal pages are seen above) describes visual journaling like this:</p>

<p><em>Looking at other people’s pages shows what a wide range of journals people keep. For some people, it is a diary, a notebook, a record of their experiments, a resource for later reference, or somewhere to let out their deepest feelings. Some are really sketchbooks with a few more words than usual. Some are mainly words with some decoration – painted backgrounds, doodles, cartoons or more realistic sketches. Some are multi-layered mixed media art. Anything goes! There are no rights or wrongs in journalling, just what works best for you. I’m still in the experimenting stage – looking at a lot of other people’s work, and trying out styles and materials.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/77118/1">topic of art journaling</a> was recently brought up in the Swap-bot forums by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mrsdutton">mrsdutton</a> and many helpful users responded with some great tips and links.

<p>You may remember that last week I posted a <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/05/05/dutch-swappers-group/">profile of the Dutch Swappers Group</a>. Well, the group continues to be extremely active and over the weekend 20 members of the group got together in person!</p>

<p><a href="http://s1215.photobucket.com/albums/cc506/DutchSwappers/?action=view&amp;current=DutchSwappersBoekelenAppeltern11en12juni20112.jpg&amp;currenttag=Dutch%20Swappers%20Bijeenkomst%20in%20Boekel%20en%20Appeltern#!oZZ5QQcurrentZZhttp%3A%2F%2Fs1215.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fcc506%2FDutchSwappers%2F%3Faction%3Dview%26current%3DDutchSwappersBoekelenAppeltern11en12juni201112.jpg%26currenttag%3DDutch%20Swappers%20Bijeenkomst%20in%20Boekel%20en%20Appeltern"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DutchSwappers3.jpg" alt="" title="DutchSwappers3" width="470" height="329" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8202" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DutchSwappers3-300x210.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DutchSwappers3.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>

<p>This was the third official meet up of the group. They met in in Boekel, a southern town in the Netherlands. Attendees included <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:IlonaH">IlonaH</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Kimminita">Kimminita</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:littleZ">littleZ</a>, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Kyroushka">Kyroushka</a>, and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:8r1id">8r1id</a>, who hosted the event at her home.</p>

<p><a href="http://s1215.photobucket.com/albums/cc506/DutchSwappers/?action=view&amp;current=DutchSwappersBoekelenAppeltern11en12juni201128.jpg&amp;currenttag=Dutch%20Swappers%20Bijeenkomst%20in%20Boekel%20en%20Appeltern"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DutchSwappers2.jpg" alt="" title="DutchSwappers2" width="470" height="353" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8201" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DutchSwappers2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DutchSwappers2.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>

<p>Everyone brought something to eat or drink, they played a “Pass the Parcel” swap game, and Kimminita gave a workshop in drawing mandalas. Some of the attendees stayed overnight, and went to the gardens of Appeltern the next day. It looks like it was a lot of fun and great weather, too!</p>

<p>ATCs (Artist Trading Cards) are one of the most popular items swapped on Swap-bot. They are small works of art the size of a traditional baseball or trading card, and they can be created either to match a specific swap theme or just to represent your individual artistic style. You can find more info about ATCs <a href="http://www.artist-trading-cards.ch/">here</a>. (Above you see three ATCs by Swap-bot user, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CSNYfan">CSNYfan</a>. You can view more of her beautiful creations in her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31556640@N03/">Flickr stream</a>.)</p>

The group was founded back in 2009 and is unique in that it is juried – meaning that all those interested in joining must submit images of their past ATC work in order to be considered for admission. Restricting membership in that way may seem intense, but it ensures that the group is comprised of serious ATC lovers who are interested in high quality ATC swaps. People who are comfortable doing some hand drawn work and don’t rely too heavily on scrapbook elements to complete ATCs would be a great fit for the “Artist Trading Cards – Swap your Art” group.</p>

<p>Here is a bit more info about the group from its description:</p>

<p><em>“This is a group for people who want to ensure that they are going to be delighted with their ATC packages. You don’t need to be an expert artist to join, but you must put 100% effort and dedicate time to your ATCs, both of which will be obvious in your work no matter what level of artist you are. These requirements may seem intimidating – we are just a group of people who like to try new things, add some hand-drawn/handpainted elements and work to create things that will always delight our partners!”</em></p>

<p>The group has hosted a wide variety of ATC swaps, including copper repousse and art metal embossing, as well as ATCs made with gesso, markers, watercolor, colored pencils, weaving and collage. If you are fairly confident in your ATC making skills but still like to learn and experiment with new things, the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/b7ac9fffaef995ceb446009f94286ac1/about">“Artist Trading Cards – Swap your Art” group</a> may be the perfect group for you!</p>

There are over 1200 groups to choose from on the ‘bot, so I am happy that user, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CarrieZee">CarrieZee</a>, brought one of the many great groups to my attention for this week’s group profile.</p>

<p>Let me introduce you to <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/dfbb6fbc5bb4e343d50ed11d65a76c6c/about">Somerset Style</a>! The group hosts craft swaps inspired by the style popularized by the <a href="http://www.stampington.com/magazines/">Stampington Publications</a>, like <a href="http://www.stampington.com/somersetlife/">Somerset Life</a>, <a href="http://www.stampington.com/bellearmoire/">Belle Amoire</a>, <a href="http://www.stampington.com/somersetapprentice/">Apprentice</a>, <a href="http://www.stampington.com/greencraft/">Green Craft</a>, etc. The group was founded in October 2009 by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:YooperHill">YooperHill</a> and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:homeandheart">homeandheart</a>.</p>

<p>Somerset Style swaps are of an exceptionally high quality. All group members must have completed at least ten craft swaps before joining the group, as well as have no 1 or recent 3 ratings. The swaps are all craft-related and often feature embellished paper crafts. Below is an upcycled wall pocket made by CarrieZee for a Somerset Style swap<a></a>: &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Upcoming Somerset Style swaps include <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/90360">Pretty Postcard Presentation</a> and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/90443">Somerset Green: Gift Card Holder</a>. If those swaps sound fun to you and you meet the group requirements, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/dfbb6fbc5bb4e343d50ed11d65a76c6c/about">request to join</a>!</p>

The group, founded by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:littleZ">littleZ</a>, has 192 members. All of the members of the group live in The Netherlands and much of the group description and the very active forums are in Dutch.</p>

<p>Group member, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:8r1id">8r1id</a> contacted me recently to let me know that the group is planning their third in-person meet-up. How cool! She says that the group is very active and the members have become good friends. 8r1id also made the amazing felt fairytale dolls seen below for the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/85083">Sprookjeskunst (fairytale art) Swap</a>. I love them!</p>

		<p>I recently received a copy of the amazing “Going Postal Gallery,” a mail art zine created by Swap-bot member <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TangleCrafts">TangleCrafts</a>, and I just had to share it with you…</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine1.jpg" alt="" title="goingpostalzine1" width="470" height="306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5664" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine1-300x195.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine1.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>

<p>From the zine’s cover description: “In January 2010 <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TangleCrafts">TangleCrafts</a> launched a new mail art project, inviting artists and crafters worldwide to submit a postal or mail art themed ATCs (an ATC is an Artist’s Trading Card – the only requirements for them being that they are only ever traded – never bought or sold – and that they each measure 2.5″ x 3.5″). All contributions received a free copy of a mini-zine featuring their artwork in exchange. The project drew to a close on August 31st, 2010, and this zine-shaped ‘gallery’ showcases all contributions received, plus notes on inspiration, techniques, and crafty habits from the artists. Enjoy!”</p>

<p>For more information about the project, check out the <a href="http://tanglecrafts.wordpress.com/mailart/going-postal/">mail art section of TangleCraft’s blog</a>.</p>

<p>—–</p>

<p>I can’t share all of the awesome ATCs included in the Going Postal zine, but here are a few examples…</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine2.jpg" alt="" title="goingpostalzine2" width="470" height="641" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5665" /></a></p>

<p>The top ATC is titled “My favourite time of the day: Special Delivery” and it was created by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:oliviarrow">oliviarrow</a> using pen and watercolor.</p>

<p>The lower ATC by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:farstarr">farstarr</a> was created with upcycled materials including a cancelled fish stamp, and is titled “Fish in the Mail Make my Heart Beat Faster.”</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine3.jpg" alt="" title="goingpostalzine3" width="470" height="629" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5666" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine3-224x300.jpg 224w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine3.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>

<p>The top card here is actually an ACEO (Art Cards, Editions and Originals) created by <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/HazelFisherCreations?ref=seller_info">Hazel Fisher</a>. It is a gouache painting of a British postbox.</p>

<p>The bottom ATC is a moveable collage created by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:T%C3%ADaBel">TiaBel</a> of Swap-bot. The flag can be moved and inside the tiny envelope is a personalized postmark.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine4.jpg"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine4.jpg" alt="" title="goingpostalzine4" width="470" height="634" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5667" /></a></p>

<p>All three of the ATCs seen above were created by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:peony">peony</a>. They are collages utilizing stamps, maps, envelopes, and other ephemera. I love the use of the airmail stripes!</p>

<p>It is always exciting to see how our members utilize Swap-bot in unique ways!</p>

<p>Swap-bot user, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Rainbowlicker">Rainbowlicker</a>, hosted a fantastic swap last month that combined postcard swapping with an appreciation project at her local library. In the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/69475">I Love My Library swap</a>, we each sent a postcard to our one partner describing why we love our local library. Then, we each ALSO sent a postcard with a similar sentiment to the Aurora Memorial Library in Ohio. Rainbowlicker is a librarian there and she used the postcards from the 60+ swap participants to create the display shown above. (Check out Ernie at the top! yay!)</p>

<p>Here is her description of why she wanted to complete this project:</p>

<p>“As a librarian and avid reader, I do not know where I would be without mine. With the recent downturn in the economy libraries were hit especially hard so I think it is time to show them some love! …I want to show our children and patrons how much people from all over love their library!”</p>

<p>Libraries are such amazing community resources. (I used to work at my local library in high school and it helped me discover countless new books and authors.) I am thrilled that Swap-bot could help make this library appreciation project possible!</p>

Users and met at Gypsy’s home to work on ATCs for upcoming Swap-bot swaps. The two live near each other and thought it would be fun to meet. Gypsy says, <em>“We had such a great time crafting, drinking tea and munching on treats! Next time we meet we’ll do some watercoloring.”</em> Sounds fun to me!You can see a few more photos of the meet-up on .</p>

<p>Three Swap-bot members from the met up last Saturday, January 30th. Members (plus her mom), , and all met in Portland, Oregon, at loricritt’s home.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/NWcrafts.jpg" alt="NWcrafts" title="NWcrafts" width="470" height="197" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4912" /></p>

<p>The evening was spent crafting, of course! Tarabell150 brought bottle caps and the necessary tools to show everyone how to make bottle cap buttons, which they painted with alcohol inks. Loricritt supplied the necessities to make glass pendants, and there was also a “show and tell” of ATCs, Skinnys, Inchies, Dotees, and Button Fairies. Sounds like a fun afternoon!</p>

<p><em>If any other Swap-bot groups gather together, please take photos and please let me know about your event! I would love to publish a report like this one here on the blog. You can email me at rachel@swap-bot.com.</em></p>

<p>Whew. What a wonderful time I had last night! Hosting was such a great experience. All of the matchboxes seen above were created by the attendees of the event. They were all so sweet and creative! Swap-bot loves forever!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/craftnightgroup.jpg" alt="craftnightgroup" title="craftnightgroup" width="470" height="267" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4900" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/craftnightgroup-300x170.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/craftnightgroup.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>

<p>There were about 30-40 attendees at the in-person event at the Etsy Labs and about 50 people watching the Virtual Labs video tutorial. Thank you to everyone – especially Swap-bot members – who came and watched. Lisa (Swap-bot username ) came to the in-person event early and helped set up, and I know I saw at least one Swap-botter (thanks, !) and my mom in the Virtual Labs! Were any other ‘botters there that I missed?</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mejulie.jpg" alt="mejulie" title="mejulie" width="453" height="362" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4901" /></p>

<p>In addition to the Swap-bot peeps, I met a ton of new people at the Craft Night, like , , Colette, Rachel, Elaine, and so many more. I wish I had taken more time to remember everyone’s names and ask them more about themselves. Alas, I was caught up in trying to explain the matchbox procedure clearly and pushing treats and Swap-bot swag on everyone! I hope they forgive me. Above is a photo of me and , the super-cool organizer of Etsy Craft Nights. She does a great job and she really made the night go smoothly. Travis and our friend, , also came by at the end of the evening and helped me close up shop. Everyone was so helpful, friendly, and supportive. It was a great night.</p>

<p><strong>Art &amp; Soul Retreat 2009</strong> by</p>

<p>I was at the Art and Soul Retreat in Portland, Oregon, Oct 1 to the 5th. It was so much fun. I thought I would share it with you…</p>

<p>It is amazing to meet Swap-bot friends, you feel so comfortable right off. It is amazing!</p>

<p>I rode the train down to Portland on Thursday and it was so nice. The train is so quiet. You have so much more space and you can get up if you want to. The seats are nice and comfortable and pretty views for a lot of the trip, if you can stay awake. The Art &amp; Soul Retreat was at the Embassy hotel and at the Holiday Inn hotel. The main office and the store were at the Embassy and they had classes at both hotels. We were staying at the Holiday Inn. Both hotels had shuttles that would take us back and forth and we could ride on either one. It was like a mile and a half – too far to haul a bag full of crafting and art supplies! The drivers were so nice and friendly.</p>

<p>Brenda () got in on Friday night. Her flight was an hour early and I was not in the room when she got there. I was surprised when I opened the door at 9:30 and there she was. I was expecting her after 10! We chatted a little bit before it was time to hit the sack. She was tired from her flight and I was tired from my day of crafting.</p>

<p>We met Lori () on Saturday at the Portland Saturday Market, which is a an arts and crafts market. Then, she took us to lunch at a really cool restaurant and took us to the Rose Garden where we sniffed hundreds of roses, and then to the biggest book store ever, Powells bookstore. She was a lot of fun. We did a lot of chatting and laughing.</p>

<p>We had dinner Sunday with Marina () and her boyfriend Steve. They came back to our room with us and we did show and tell with our projects we had made. Marina brought some gorgeous quilts that she has made and Steve makes the most gorgeous wood items out of exotic woods. He could name every one of them, and everything he made was so smooth and beautiful. Two very talented people! It was so cute how proud they are of each other.</p>

<p>Of course, I bought too much stuff! The Saturday vendor night at the Art and Soul Retreat was amazing. It was even larger than I expected. Lori and her partner came. Most of the artist teachers had tables with their original works and books they have written. All of the other booths were full of old vintage items that could be used in altered art. There were only about two booths with some new stuff. I bought three precut book leathers for only $10. I could not believe how low her prices were!</p>

<p>The on-site store at the retreat was just great. It had pretty much everything you could possibly need for the classes and a ton of collage sheets and ephemera. My teachers were wonderful. The classes were a lot of fun! I just need to do some finishing touches on two of the projects, and the third project I have more ambitious plans for.</p>

<p>Friday, I had a class on Coptic binding a book with window and niches. We made the book from the very beginning decorating our covers and cutting windows. Then we learned the double Coptic stich. I have a few more finishing touches on mine. Or, maybe a lot if I decide to keep it and decorate the inside. Lots of joking and laughter in this class even though there were only seven people in it.</p>

<p>Saturday was our sightseeing day and we met Lori and had a fantastic time. It was great that we had picked that day so we could get to know each other a little better.</p>

<p>Sunday, my class was taught by the owner of . We decorated “Dream Boxes.” We got to use so many of the products from her store, which were high quality and fun to work with. I recommend the German Scrap and transparancy and collage sheets . We made a little pendant one first and then we made a larger one. I have a couple of finishing touches I want to do on this one also. Again, lots of joking and laughter in this class even with only six participants.</p>

<p>Monday’s class was called the “Ultimate Passion Book” – a cute name for making a book. We started with an accordion book kit and glued pages together so that it was a four page book. Our instructor was really into Gesso and gave us some great ideas for using it. Her basic formula for making the book after the pages were glued was to gesso the pages, putting it on real thick sometimes stamping into it and sometimes using a stencil to put it down. Then, rub in paint and wipe off. I stuck to a palette of blue, green and an antiquing color (similar to a yellowish ochre color). The next step is to collage if desired. Then, add some more paint and add any pictures or text that you want to show. Finish it off with pastels to emphasize elements. I did not get to the pastel point on this one. I choose to go with an Alice in Wonderland theme, they had a collage sheet in the store and it is the theme for next year’s Art and Soul. The instructor had music playing while we were working, not too loud just a good background when people got real quiet and into what they were doing. She had so many people sign up that she had two rooms! She did all her demos in one room and in the other she had a drying station set up with heat guns and an ephemera table. She was so nice and patient with people. There were thirty-two people, but we had lots of room to work. It is amazing how much supplies everyone brings! People freely share items and borrow tools.</p>

<p>Like I said, all the instructors were just awesome. Knowledgeable, talented, friendly, cheerful and pleasant. Almost all of the attendees were friendly, cheerful, and pleasant with various degree of skills. In the last class we had one lady that did not have much of a clue, but since a lot of people did the instructor was able to spend more time with her. But, she was careful to spread herself around and not concentrate too much on one person.</p>

<p>It was such a fantastic trip. I hope that I can go when they are in Portland next year.</p>

<p>That’s my story and I am sticking to it, Linda</p>
