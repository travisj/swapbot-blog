<p>Enter to win this great sponsored giveaway from <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">The Ultimate Handmade European Sample Box</a>. Bree from <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">geteurofied.com</a> is launching an all-European, bi-monthly sample box filled with amazing craft samples from independent artists and crafters from all over Europe on December 1st. A sample box is a great way to find out about up and coming indie artists and crafters. They contain full-size samples of handmade goodies made by small, independent businesses. Bree wanted to give Swap-bot users an early chance to win one of the grand opening Get Eurofied sample boxes. Fabulous!</p>

<p>I asked Bree a few questions about herself and <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">geteurofied.com</a> :</p>

<p><strong>How did you come up with the idea of The Ultimate European Handmade Sampler Box?</strong></p>

<p>I had participated in another sampler box for my own <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5563462">etsy shop</a> and had such a great time creating fun samples. I then purchased <a href="http://www.thespottedbox.com/">The Spotted Box</a> and realized all the sellers participating were based in the states. So I thought… let’s get the Europeans on the map! I am an American living in Denmark for the past two years and I am so inspired by all of the great designs here. Just while walking down the street to grab a cup of coffee I am inspired by the European culture. Then…the story begins.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get involved in independent arts and crafts?</strong></p>

<p>I have always been a creative soul. I remember coloring in my Rainbow Brite Coloring Book and designing outfits with my Tomy Fashion Plates. (uh-oh, did I just give away my age?) That then led me to becoming a Wardrobe Stylist after high school and the creative streak has never gone away. After 10 years of fashion, style and design, it is who I am. I also write a <a href="http://www.stylistdiva.com/">fashion blog</a> that’s filled with fab ETSY shops! I love to be able to dig into my craft stash, turn on some great music and let the party begin!</p>

<p><strong>How does the sampler box help independent artists and crafters?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">Get Eurofied</a> is a fantastic way for all of the skilled, independent Europeans to show off their online shops and share their talents with the world. The boxes are filled with handmade items that will show the buyer what kind of quality they will be getting while shopping at each of the participating stores. Once the buyer is enticed by the unique samples it is obvious that they will generate more business.</p>

<p><strong>What types of things will the Get Eurofied sample boxes contain?</strong></p>

<p>Some of the samples are earrings, fabric pouches, brooches, hairpins, necklaces, bookmarks, and MANY more fab surprises! (<a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/Participants.html">Go here</a> to see the current list of Get Eurofied participants.) When I say samples I really mean a “FULL SIZE ITEM – ready to use” for yourself or to give as a gift that you will be proud of giving. These boxes are over the top!</p>

<p>—————-</p>

<p>Would you like to win one of the Get Eurofied sample boxes? Simply answer the following question in the comments section of this post.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite type of item to purchase from independent artists or crafters?</strong></p>

<p>We will draw one lucky winner on Sunday, November 30th. Each person can only enter once. You must have a Swap-bot account in good standing (not suspended) with a valid mailing address to enter. You must include your Swap-bot username somewhere in your comment. (FYI: This prize will be mailed directly from Bree at geteurofied.com. I will provide her with the winner’s mailing info.) You must comment on, or before, Saturday, November 29th, to be entered in the drawing. If you have trouble commenting on the blog, you can send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. Good luck!</p>

<p>If you are not the big winner, don’t fret! You can get your own European Sample Box starting December 1st at <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">geteurofied.com</a>.</p>
