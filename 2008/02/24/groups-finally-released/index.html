    <p>We finally just jumped in and did it – we have publicly released the Swap-bot Groups system. The system is still a bit clunky and definitely not perfect, but if we waited for perfection nothing would ever get done!</p>

<p>So, what does this mean? It means that everyone can now (easily) create and search for groups! The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/index.php">“Find Groups”</a> link is now located on the left sidebar of non-forum Swap-bot pages. There you can search for groups that match your interests and go to their homepage to request to join. Or, you can create your own group! Have fun!</p>

<p><strong>GENERAL GROUP INFO</strong></p>

<p>Swap-bot groups were created to better enhance the swapping community. You can create groups around any interest, demographic or anything you choose! Multiple groups may be created that address similar interests. That is ok. Everyone is free to create any groups they want. However, kindness and consideration are always appreciated. If you plan to create a group that is identical to one already in existence, it would be best to contact the other group’s founder first…</p>

<p><strong>Membership Levels</strong></p>

<p>There are three different levels of group membership:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Member:</strong> Group Members join group swaps and participate in the group-specific forum.</li>
  <li><strong>Officer:</strong> Group Officers have the same privileges as Group Members, plus they can create group swaps and invite other Swap-bot members to their group.</li>
  <li><strong>Founder:</strong> Group Founders have the same privileges as Group Officers, plus they can approve group join requests, remove Members or Officers from the group, promote or demote Members and Officers. In addition, Group Founders have swap coordinator privileges for any group swaps (even if they did not create the swap). At this time each group can only have one founder. In the future we hope to make it so that there can be multiple founders.</li>
</ol>

<p>FYI: In the future we hope to make the group membership levels more fluid and changeable…</p>

<p><strong>Groups Swaps</strong></p>

<p>Only those Swap-bot members that belong to the group can join a group swap. (The Swap-bot computer prevents non-members from signing up.) Group swaps are not listed on the public search page or any of the swap lists. However, group swaps are listed on member profile pages and are not meant to be hidden from non group members.</p>

<p><strong>Accepting new members</strong></p>

<p>In addition to forming niche swapping communities, Groups can be used to ensure you only swap with other members you trust. If you are a Founder or Officer in a group it is your responsibility to the group to ensure that only trustworthy swappers make it into your group. <em>Swap-bot admin cannot help with any group conflicts.</em></p>

<p>—–</p>

<p>We are very excited about Swap-bot Groups… but it has proven to be a much larger endeavor than first thought. There is still much work to be done. Please explore the system and give us any feedback you have. Like all of Swap-bot, Groups are an evolving and constantly improving entity.</p>

<p>The Group Beta Testers have been an awesome help. They have given us tons of suggestions, many of which we are still working to implement. If you are a member of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/30b241498eececb662539242308e5c6e/about">Swap-bot Beta Testers group</a></p>

<p>, please go to the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/30b241498eececb662539242308e5c6e/about">homepage</a> for information about adding a special beta tester badge to your profile.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone for your help and patience!</p>

<p>Happy swapping,</p>

<p>Rachel</p>
