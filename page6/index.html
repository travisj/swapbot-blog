<p>————</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Aankee">Aankee</a>!</strong> Aankee lives in Munich, Germany, and has been a member of Swap-bot since the beginning of 2013. She loves snail mail, envelope making, and postcard collecting. She has done 75 swaps.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/aankee1.png" alt="aankee1" width="300" height="448" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11299" /><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Germany</p>

<p><strong>How Aankee found Swap-bot:</strong> “I first heard of Swap-bot many years ago in an interview you gave on Sister Diane’s <a href="http://www.craftypod.com">CraftyPod</a> podcast. Back then, I was an active Postcrosser and Swap-bot sounded fun, so eventually I joined! Now, I’m an absolute Swap-bot convert, because it’s a fun and diverse place and there’s so much more to do than exchange postcards!”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “My favourite aspect of Swap-bot is the opportunity to share my crafty creations with others, try out new things, get feedback and advice from more expert artists, meet like-minded people, experience the kindness of strangers… and many more!”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite swaps are postcard, letter, and drawing swaps. I haven’t participated in millions of swaps, as I believe in quality over quantity. However, I would be excited to participate in one-to-one swaps, and send out German ephemera.”</p>

<p><strong>Check out Aankee’s illustrations done for a monster-themed postcard swap:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Interesting fact about Aankee:</strong> “I have lived in a European, an African and an Asian capital city, by the beach in France and in a manor house in the English country side, and yet my favourite place on earth is my parent’s patio.”</p>

<p><strong>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:moonlightlaura">moonlightlaura</a>!</strong> Moonlightlaura has been a member of Swap-bot since the beginning of 2013. She has done nearly one hundred swaps and makes really awesome crafts inspired by our cute logo mascot, Ernie the Envie. (<a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2013/10/29/ernie-is-ready-for-halloween/">Check out her Franken-Ernie made for a Halloween swap last year.</a>)</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/moonlightlaura.png" alt="moonlightlaura" width="331" height="454" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11290" /><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Southern Region, USA</p>

<p><strong>Info about moonlightlaura’s region:</strong> “I describe Louisiana as a hot and humid place to live, with a lot of diversity. Some people have a southern accent, but others don’t, like myself. We have swamps, marshes, and bayous. I live by Bayou Teche.</p>

<p>When it rains bad it becomes flooded around the areas closest to it. Thankfully we are not close enough to get flooded! We also have hurricane season between June 1 and November 30. Every few years we will get hit, but our area hasn’t been hit since 2008 when Gustav and Ike hit us within a week apart in September. In the winter it can get cold, last winter (2012) we didn’t have much of a winter, but this year (2013) we had freezing temps almost every day. We also had several road closures due to ice being on the bridges and roads.</p>

<p>The food here is great, although I don’t eat most of it. Even though I was born and raised in Louisiana, I was never raised on a lot of the food everyone here loves so much. I do love beignets though! I would have to say that is one of my favorite foods from here.</p>

<p>The rest of the south is pretty much the same weather wise to Louisiana, and the southern region is not very mountainous. It is mostly flat land, and most of the southern states has the Gulf of Mexico as a body of water for their shores.”</p>

<p><strong>How she found Swap-bot:</strong> “I think I came upon Swap-Bot by clicking on a banner on <a href="http://www.postcrossing.com">postcrossing.com</a>. I love sending and receiving postcards on there. My postcard collection has grown since joining.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I enjoy Swap-bot because I have been able to swap with many people who are very talented with their crafting, and also I was able to get many things I could not get where I live. It is fun to join swaps and receive great packages.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite types of swaps are the sticker swaps, the kawaii swaps, the moving along excess swaps and the Ernie the Envie swaps.”</p>

<p><strong>Check out one of moonlightlaura’s Ernie-inspired swaps:</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/moonlightlaura2.png" alt="moonlightlaura2" width="600" height="561" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11291" /></p>

<p>“Made for the Ernie the Envie Holiday Happiness swap, it is a box painted in winter colors (blue and white) with a plastic canvas Ernie on top of the box. It also has snowflake stickers on the sides and glow in the dark glitter mixed with blue glitter paint so the box will glow.”</p>

<p><strong>Interesting fact about moonlightlaura:</strong> “I am also an avid photographer. I love taking pics of things, especially of my cats and of the aircrafts we paint at work.”</p>

<p>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Lanie">Lanie</a>! Lanie has been a member of Swap-bot since 2010 but she is selective about her swaps, completing a total of 46. She loves Harry Potter, sci-fi, and chocolate… sounds like she and I have a lot in common!!</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Florida, USA<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lanie.jpg" alt="lanie" width="300" height="336" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11283" /></p>

<p><strong>How Lanie found Swap-bot:</strong> “I think it was through a thread on Etsy but not 100% sure as it was like 4 years ago.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I love it because it’s easy to use, you meet lots of great people and you get to share your talents with them.”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “I like swaps where I can really use my talents and make things to send to others. Sometimes though I don’t always get the same effort in return but at least the person tried. ”</p>

<p><strong>Check out two of Lanie’s wonderful altered tin swaps:</strong></p>

<p>————</p>

<p>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mag">mag</a>! Mag has been a member of Swap-bot since 2007 and she has completed more than 260 swaps. Wow! She loves crafting and exploring the world and other cultures through snail mail.</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Singapore <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo.jpg" alt="photo" width="325" height="217" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11270" /></p>

<p><strong>How mag found Swap-bot:</strong> “I remember in 2007, before I entered university, I wanted to travel the world and experience the culture of every single country. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the funds to do so. So I searched for a way to get that same experience in the comfort of my home, and you wouldn’t imagine how elated I was to find a site that allowed me to achieve that wish.</p>

<p>Also at that time, I became more involved in the art of handmade and I used this opportunity to exchange handmade goods as well as craft supplies. This expanded not just my creative tools, but my imagination as well. It wasn’t long before I became ‘addicted’ to swapping with all the happy mail filling my letterbox.”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “Today, although I have begun fulfilling my dream of travelling the world, I continue to do cultural exchanges because I love to see the world through someone else’s eyes. Also, there are so many places but so little time, so this has allowed me to explore more within a shorter span of time. Swapping has also expanded my crafting sphere and I love the thrill of giving and receiving something special. Furthermore, it has helped me expand my social circle beyond my country as I started penpalling with those I ‘met’ through the site. I couldn’t be more thankful for this site!”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “Cultural, handmade, and themed swaps.”</p>

<p><strong>One of mag’s most excellent sent swaps:</strong> “This was rather difficult for me to choose, so here’s my most recent cultural swap from Singapore to Portugal.” <em>(Seen below.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Interesting facts about mag:</strong> “I love pretending I’m a tourist in my own country and sussing out this place with a fresh perspective.”</p>

<p>————</p>

<p>Meet our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ColoradoKate">ColoradoKate</a>! ColoradoKate has been a Swap-bot member since 2011 and she has completed more than 240 swaps. She loves kawaii, postcards, and tea!</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> USA – Colorado</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/coloradokateportrait.png" alt="coloradokateportrait" width="600" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11247" /></p>

<p><strong>How ColoradoKate found Swap-bot:</strong> “I found Swap-bot when I started looking for penpals! I had just watched the BBC’s Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice, and I wanted to write more letters!”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “Swap-bot is a place where I’ve made some very faithful friends and penpals – people who’ve stuck with me through my pregnancy hiatus!”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite swaps are letter swaps with beautiful stationery, hand cancelled stamps, and something real to say.”</p>

<p><strong>One of ColoradoKate’s most excellent sent swaps:</strong> “It was a Kawaii sticker flakes, matchbox, and surprise swap. I sent a little box of Apollo candy and some acrylic nails I decorated myself. I don’t only do Kawaii though, so I’ve also included a Small Denominations Stamps on an Envelope swap I did. I was sending to Canada, so I sent the full complement of USPS American Design stamps. Those rubber stamps I used were hand carved by another Swap-bot member!” <em>(Both swaps seen below)</em></p>

<p><strong>Say hello to our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:chelle523">chelle523</a>!</strong> Chelle523 is an <strong>Original Member</strong>, which means she has been on Swap-bot since before June, 2007. She has completed more than 360 swaps and received more than 650 “5” ratings! Amazing!</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> USA – Midwest Region</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/michelle-closeup.jpg" alt="michelle closeup" width="245" height="218" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11230" /><strong>How chelle523 found Swap-bot:</strong> “I found Swap-bot in 2006 (if I remember correctly). At the time I was on a Yahoo swapping group that traded ATCs, and had gotten discouraged at the lack of diversity in swaps and wanted to expand. A friend told me about Swap-bot and I’ve been hooked ever since!”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I love Swap-bot – it combines the best in artistic and creative expression, friendship and generosity, fun and it allows me to “meet” people from all corners of the globe! I love meeting people that share my interests and talents and I love meeting people whose lives and skills are completely different than my own! That little burst of excitement I get when I see an envelope or package in the mailbox is enough to make me a Swap-botter for life! I mean, when 90% of what we get in the mail is bills or junk, how can getting a beautiful envelope from across the world not put a smile on your face!?!”</p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite types of swaps are journals, pen pal swaps and whimsy jars, but honestly, I like just about every kind of swap we have.” <em>Obviously, chelle523 is also interested in ATCs. Check out three of her wonderful ATC creations below…</em></p>

<p><strong>Say hello to our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:heidec">HeideC</a>!</strong> HeideC is an <strong>Original Member</strong>, which means she has been on Swap-bot since before June, 2007. Awesome!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/heidec.jpg" alt="heidec" width="300" height="378" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11220" /><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> USA – Cincinnati, Ohio &amp; Ohio Valley Region</p>

<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/heidec/">HeideC’s Flickr photos!</a></strong> (She has lots of swap and craft photos!)</p>

<p><strong>How HeideC found Swap-bot:</strong> “I think I originally found Swap-bot when I was trying to get some information about ATCs. When I googled ATC some flickr pictures came up and they referred to Swap-bot. The rest, as they say, is history!”</p>

<p><strong>Why she enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I love Swap-bot for its diversity and its acceptance of inexperience! When I look back on some of the ATCs, I have made I cringe a little…the first ones were very rough! I still remember the first ATC I made that I felt so very proud of <em>(seen below)</em>. It’s still on my flickr account as my favorite ATC. And having the advice of more experienced artists really helps. Swap-bot gave me the courage to make my first quilt…something I never thought I could do. Now I get people at work asking me to make quilts for them; its quite a boost to my self-esteem!”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/heidec/3679438837/"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/heidecatc.jpg" alt="heidecatc" width="600" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11221" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Her favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite type of swap at the moment is ATCs, but I am also having fun in the Thriftstore Find group, its really a challenge to find something your partner will like that also fits the swap theme. As an example, the February theme was “red”… I found a tin that had previously held red scottie dog shaped licorice, filled it with other red goodies, taped it shut and mailed it naked… the Post Office ladies loved that one!”</p>

<p><strong>Interesting facts about HeideC:</strong> “I love yard sales and go to the flea market every Wednesday morning. I love to read and read 3-4 books a week. My favorite flowers are lilacs, lilly of the valley and lavender.”</p>
