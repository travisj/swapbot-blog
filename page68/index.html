<p>A reminder for any local Pacific Northwest swappers, this weekend is the Swap-bot Member Appreciation Event!</p>

<p>The event will be held on Sunday, March 1st, from 12 – 3 pm at the Lamb Cottage in Skinner Butte Park (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=101+Cheshire+Ave,+Eugene+OR+97401&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=61.669968,87.363281&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=44.060607,-123.095584&amp;spn=0.027817,0.042658&amp;z=15">address: 101 Cheshire Ave, Eugene OR 97401</a> ). It is a charming location (right by the Willamette River in the park) with plenty of parking. The plan is to have balloons on the outside of the cottage so that you know where the party is at!</p>

<p>Most of the event will consist of meeting each other and socializing, but there are a few organized activities, too. On the (very loose) agenda for the event is a short talk by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj">Travis</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">Rachel</a> about Swap-bot with plenty of time for questions, an altered matchbox construction demo, a few announcements from local crafters and businesses, and an ATC trade facilitated by Swap-bot member <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:coffeelatte">coffeelatte</a> at 2 pm.

<p>This is the first edition of a new Swap-bot blog series: <strong>Member Spotlights</strong> . Our plan is to interview and highlight a new Swap-bot member every other week. This week, we would like to introduce you to <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sewcrazy"><strong>sewcrazy</strong></a>. Sewcrazy’s real name is Betty and she is one of the most prolific swappers on the ‘bot. At this time, she is the member with the most hearts: 842!! She has sent nearly 600 swaps and has received over 1000 ratings! Wow! Betty loves swapping ATCs, and you can see her holding one of her many ATC binders in the photo above. (As for the car behind Betty, her husband of 43 years, Bill, is a huge fan of NASCAR.)</p>

<p>I asked Betty a few questions about herself and her love of swapping…</p>

<p><strong>How did you first get involved with Swap-bot?</strong></p>

<p>I was trading ATCs on another site and Jennifer, the coordinator of ‘Somethings Fishy,’ told me about this site.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite item to swap?</strong></p>

<p>I have enjoyed swapping ATCs the most for two reasons: one, because I just love creating these little treasures of art, and two, because if and when I get flaked on (and yes, there has been a few) I am not really loosing much. Not that I consider my ATCs ‘not much’. I just feel there has to be a reason why my partners’ ATCs didn’t get to their destination. It hasn’t stopped me from continuing to swap.</p>

<p><strong>Do you usually do international or more local swaps?</strong></p>

<p>I do international on the ATCs only, because postage-wise it isn’t too expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Describe the best (or one of the best) swap packages you have ever received?</strong></p>

<p>I have received so many good swaps that I couldn’t really name one. But, I think my favorite was the comment and heart that I received from a partner to whom I sent, and she sent me a thank you surprise. She was ecstatic about a set of ATCs. It made me feel very good.</p>

<p><strong>What do you like most about swapping?</strong></p>

<p>The friendship and the chance to show off what I do, good or bad, people are very receptive of everything.</p>

<p><strong>How much time per week do you spend working on swaps?</strong></p>

<p>I couldn’t really say how much time I spend per week. Sometimes I can sit down and whip out a bunch of ATCs and other times I struggle to come up with the theme. I usually have them done ahead of time and waiting for my partners’ names. I sign up for a swap only if I can envision the ATC and have the materials to create it, without having to run to town to get something to complete it.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a type of swap have you always wanted to try, but haven’t yet?</strong></p>

<p>I have probably tried most swaps. Some only once, others more to try and get a feel for them. But, I always end up sticking to ATCs, I like them the most.</p>

<p><strong>What are your other hobbies, besides swapping?</strong></p>

<p>I am a seamstress, love to make quilts and incorporate that talent into some of my ATCs. I teach a quilt class in Othello, Washington, where I used to live. I also have just recently taken up greeting card making. And, there again, I use some of the ideas from the cards that I make, scaled down to ATC size. I love to check out yard sales and flea markets to find treasures for my ATCs.</p>

<p><strong>What does your family and friends think of your swapping habit?</strong></p>

<p>My family enjoys seeing what I have done, I think!!! I got my daughter hooked on making ATCs. We have a lot of fun trading through swaps and sharing ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any advice for first-time swappers or new Swap-bot members?</strong></p>

<p>Enjoy what you do, don’t stress yourself out on a swap. Your work is your work, period. Don’t let anyone else’s work intimidate you. But, mostly, just enjoy what you create.</p>

<p><strong>Who would you like to see interviewed next for a member spotlight?</strong></p>

<p>That would be Swap-bot member, dolly, and of course, my daughter, VWwoman07. She is very creative and is a lot like me. I have traded with dolly a lot and she comes up with some pretty unique ATCs, I always love to receive cards from her.</p>

<p>——————–</p>

<p>Thank you, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sewcrazy">sewcrazy</a> , for your great responses and swapping advice!</p>

<p><em>(If there is a member that you would like to see interviewed, please let me know! Email rachel [at] swap-bot.com)</em></p>

<p>The word “cute” can mean many things – sickly sweet children’s things, good design, adorable fashion, kawaii, etc – and the daily blog, <a href="http://www.jarsofcute.com/">jars of cute</a>, covers all of the definitions. The site is updated multiple times a day with cute stuff and fun design finds “By Two Crafty Girls Who Are Suckers For Cool Cute Things!” Everything from fashion to photography to housewares to toys is fair game for <a href="http://www.jarsofcute.com/">jars of cute</a>. The website is a great place to find out about new designers and great gift ideas. It has only been running since June of 2008, but the amount of cute already covered seems endless!</p>

		<p>The recession is hitting everyone hard these days and sometimes crafting and swapping is especially hard to fit into our budgets. But, wait a minute! There are some great ways that we can support our crafty habits even during a recession. Following are my top five tips for recession-proof crafting:</p>

<li value="5">
  <b>Recycle and use what you already have and.</b> How many stacks and containers of supplies do you have in your craft area right now? Tons, right? Now is the time to start using your stockpiles creatively. After all, crafting is all about expressing your creativity &#8212; not buying the latest stuff at the craft store. Also, lots of everyday objects, and even things we consider to be trash, can be very helpful when crafting. Cereal boxes make great starting surfaces for postcards, Artist Trading Cards, or altered matchboxes. Old cd jewel cases can be made into <a href="http://www.24x7digital.com/content/view/91/77/">super-cute and handy calendars</a>. Plastic grocery bags can be made into all sorts of things by <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/crafting/crocheted-plastic/index.html">crocheting</a> or <a href="http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2007/08/plastic_bag_crafts.html">melting</a> them. <a href="http://www.craftbits.com/viewProject.do?projectID=155">CDs</a>, clothes pins, <a href="http://whipup.net/2009/01/12/tutorial-baby-socks-from-woollen-sweater/">old sweaters</a> , film canisters, <a href="http://tipnut.com/things-to-do-with-old-jeans/">denim</a>, <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/la/look/20-household-uses-for-newspaper-once-youve-finished-the-crossword-050121">newspaper</a>, and really anything else you can think of can be re-purposed into fun craft projects.
</li>
<li value="4">
  <b>Be patient before buying new craft supplies. </b> This is a no-brainer, but having patience really can pay off. If you must buy new things from you favorite local craft stores or online retailers, simply wait for them to put things on sale or run a promotion. This may mean buying holiday-themed items after the holiday or waiting for a special coupon to come in the mail. (Don&#8217;t we all love those 40% off <a href="http://www.michaels.com/art/online/home">Michael&#8217;s</a> coupons?!) Make a commitment to only buy sale items when/if you shop at (pricey) specialty craft stores and you will save a bundle.
</li>
<li value="3">
  <b>Shop dollar and discount stores.</b> Dollar stores and discount stores are an affordable place to find crafting supplies. Some sell craft-related things, but often you can find everyday items at discount stores that make great craft materials. Purchase clothing at thrift stores to use for fabric projects, or buy cheap children&#8217;s book to use in scrapbooking or collage. <a href="http://dollarstorecrafts.com/">Dollar Store Crafts</a> has tons of great craft ideas using inexpensive materials.
</li>
<li value="2">
  <b>Craft for a cause.</b> The recession is affecting everyone, but the poor are being hit especially hard. Take some time to create something special for someone in need and you will be sure to feel better about your own situation. For ideas check out <a href="http://handmadehelpsout.blogspot.com/search/label/Auction">Handmade Help</a> (a site dedicated to helping those affected by the Australian bush fires) and <a href="http://homespunhelpers.blogspot.com/">Homespun Helpers</a> (a group creating handmade items for multiple charities).
</li>
<li value="1">
  <b>Swap, Swap, Swap!</b> &#8211; In addition to being fun and entertaining, swapping can help replenish your craft supply stash by trading things you do not need for new-to-you supplies from other swappers. You can also continue to have fun swapping and meeting people from all over the world without spending any money by doing electronic swaps &#8211; swaps via email.
</li>

<p>So, those are my top five tips for staying crafty during the recession. What are your tips?</p>

<p>Here is her answer to the question, <strong>What is your favorite handmade valentine memory, given or received?</strong></p>

<p>Mekel Carrier on 03 Feb 2009: In Elementry School I loved makeing/decorating my own Valentine’s Day Box to put on my desk for all my classmates to put their Valentine’s to me in. I couldn’t wait to get home and look at all of them! Now I love making Valentine’s Day cards to send to my girlfriends and making something special for dinner and dessert for my hubby and I. I can’t wait until my kids are old enough to get to make the Valentine’s Day boxes again! (My swap-bot name is mommy2dylan.)</p>

<p>Congrats, mommy2dylanl! Thank you to everyone for entering. There will be a new giveaway announced shortly. xoxo</p>

		<p>Travis and I (your Swap-bot site admins) were traveling all last week, and unfortunately, our email was not always cooperating. I am behind on answering support email, but I will be trying to get caught up today. I am sorry for any inconvenience or delay. &lt;/strong&gt;</p>

		<p>Artist Trading Cards (ATCs) are still one of the most popular swap categories on Swap-bot, and there are always new themes popping up. This week we are featuring the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/30817">Steampunk ATCs swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KatarinaNavane">KatarinaNavane</a>. But, what is steampunk?</p>

<p>“Think of what someone in the Victorian era would’ve thought the future would be like–airship filled skies, fantastic gagets running on steam and clockwork…. So a Steampunk ATC might have some Victorian elements, some more modern ones, some technological. Have fun with this. People define “steampunk” for themselves to a certain extent, so don’t get too nitpicky about it. Take the aesthetic and run with it!”</p>

New users with full profiles are welcome. For the swap you send one ATC to each of your two partners for a total of two ATCs. The sign up deadline for the swap is February 28th. Make sure to read the full swap description before signing up.</p>
