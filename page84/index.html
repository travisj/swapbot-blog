		<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.swap-bot.com/images/swaps/2107/swap.jpg" />Matchbox swaps have been quite popular lately, and this week’s featured swap is th <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2107">SpringTime Kawaii Matchbox Swap</a> coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4510">Straycat</a>.</p>

<p>Kawaii is a certain style of cute products from Japan. And when I say cute, I mean CUTE! Check out the description of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii">Kawaii on Wikipedia</a>, or visit the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/japancute/">Japan Cute! blog</a> <u style="display:none">[Sideways film](http://utero.pe/?sideways)</u> to learn more about it. There have been previous swaps on swap-bot based around Kawaii, including previous <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/kawaiimatchboxswap/">Kawaii matchbox swaps</a>. A matchbox swap basically entails decorating a small matchbox and filling it full of little trinkets and goodies.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/144/321363428_2a1b3ded87_m.jpg" />The swap home page explains it this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simply load up a decorated matchbox with tiny kawaii items &amp; mail it to your partner! At least 1 store-bought Japanese kawaii item must be included. Handmade goods are optional &amp; adored! Please try to jam pack the little matchbox as much as possible. Springtime: Let’s welcome the new season with pretty colors &amp; cute animals! Kawaii: It means “cute” in Japanese. ie Sanrio, Q-Lia, Kamio, Lemon Co., Midori, etc. Matchbox: A cutely decorated 32-stick or a Euro matchbox is our goal, but… hehe If it’s cute &amp; tiny, it’s accepted! DIY, tiny candy boxes, or other purchased equivalents are a-okay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/101/363777794_1e6eee7130_m.jpg" />Things you might include in your matchbox: stickers, erasers, candies, paper clips, pins and buttons, tiny stationery, anything small, cute &amp; spring-y! The Springtime Kawaii Matchbox Swap is international, but it does require a 4.0 rating or higher. Matchbox swaps are a great way to express your creativity without spending a ton on supplies and postage! Happy swapping!</p>

<p>Thanks to Swap-bot member Gem for sending along info that we were mentioned in February 2007 issue of <a href="http://www.quickandsimple.com/">Quick and Simple Magazine</a>. I tried looking for the magazine last night, but didn’t find it. Their website has a <a href="http://central.hearstmags.com/gemini/service_files/qas/qas_primary_faqs.html#finding">list of locations</a> to get the magazine, so I’ll continue my search tomorrow.</p>

		<p><img id="image42" class="alignleft" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/swap.jpg" alt="swap.jpg" />This week we are featuring the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2088">Themed Paint Can Swap</a> coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=3548">fairykiss</a>. Each swapper only has one partner for this unique swap, which is a good idea because of the creativity and time needed to create a themed paint can. A themed or altered paint can is simply a new, clean, one-gallon paint can that has been decorated and filled according to a specific theme. Check out these <a href="http://www.scrapjazz.com/topics/Techniques/Altered_Art/512.php">instructions</a> for step by step directions on how to make one.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2088">Themed Paint Can Swap</a> is open until February 17th for signup. Participants then have over a month to check out their partner’s profile and decorate and fill a lovely paint can that matches their personality. There is a $10 <strong>minimum</strong> for the things you put inside the paint can. This swap is US only.</p>

<p><img id="image44" class="alignleft" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/beachcan.jpg" alt="beachcan.jpg" />Some themed paint can ideas: If your partner’s favorite colors happened to be pink and yellow, you could create a spring-themed paint can filled with spring stickers and stationery, flower seeds, lemon drops, sunglasses, etc… A spa-themed paint can filled with pampering goodies like bubble bath and nail polish would also be fun. Or, if your partner likes scrapbooking, a paint can filled with fun scrapbooking embellishments and tools would be sure to please! A single favorite color, or two, could also be interpreted as a theme.</p>

<p>This fun swap really gets your imagination going! It is perfect for swappers who would like to put a little extra care in creating a beautiful swap package. Have fun!</p>

It happens to be the newest feature of the Swap-bot rating system. Ratings are still based on the 5 point system, but now there is a way to re <a href="http://saveyourmoney.on-blog.com/2013/02/17/full-mind-control/" title="Full Mind Control">Full Mind Control</a> ward those swappers who really go above and beyond the swap expectations. You know the swappers I am talking about – the ones who send you those super-adorable swap packages, all decorated and filled with extra goodies, or the ones who look at your profile and manage to send you just the PERFECT item. Now you can give those special swappers a heart for being so wonderful.</p>

<p>This is what the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/rating_info.php">rating info page</a> now says about the heart system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If someone sends you an extra special swap package that far exceeds the swap requirements, you can give that person a heart. The option to give someone a heart only appears when you give them the highest rating (“I got my stuff and it met posted swap requirements”). Under this rating option a check box will appear that you can mark if you want to give a heart. You do not have to give anyone a heart just because you gave them the highest rating. We suggest that you reserve giving hearts to those swappers who you think deserve even more than the highest rating (more than 5 points). The number of hearts a person has collected will be shown on their profile page next to their average rating. Lots of hearts indicates a very special swapper!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, don’t fret, you can go back to your old swaps and retro-actively give hearts to anyone who previously sent you awesome swaps!</p>

<p>See how many hearts you can collect!</p>

		<p>We [released a few new feature upgrades](http://swap-bot.com/blog/2007/01/20/new-new-new/) yesterday and of all of them, I am most excited about the [new way coordinators assign swap partners](http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php#question17). I feel like we have taken a positive step forward in eliminating bad swappers from participating in [Swap-bot](http://www.swap-bot.com/).</p>

<p>The idea of making coordinators manually start the partner assignment process is something I have been working on for quite a while. Before this change, the process was automatic. As soon as the deadline to signup passed, partners were instantly assigned. The problem we were running into, however, is that the scammers discovered that they could sign up an hour before the partners were assigned, which wouldn’t leave enough time for the coordinator to ban them. While I feel very strongly that we have a great community of swappers, **the average rating given is a 4.6**, I am aware that even one bad apple will ruin the swap for someone. After many email discussions with helpful members of the Swap-bot community, I came up with the process we released yesterday. The coordinator now has three days manually initiate the partner assignment process. If, after three days, the coordinator hasn’t assigned partners, Swap-bot will automatically assign the partners for the coordinator.</p>

<p>Swap coordinators should already be aware of this change, an email went out to the those that are in charge of swaps that ended yesterday alerting them that it was time to initiate the assignment process. I just checked and 4 of the 20 swaps that closed signup yesterday have already had their partners assigned.</p>

<p>![Assign Partners](http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/assign_partners.png)</p>

<p>Assigning partners in Swap-bot is very easy. After signup has closed for the swap, the coordinator should return to Swap-bot to view the final list of signed up swap participants. If any of the participants do not meet swap requirements, such as minimum rating, geographical location or any other requirement, the coordinator can ban the participant from the swap and ensure that they will not be assigned a partner. Once the coordinator is happy with the final list of participants, they can simply click on the ‘Assign partners for this swap’ link.</p>

<p>Assigning partners adds a few minutes of work for the coordinator, but I feel it will greatly enhance the swap experience for all participants. I hope you agree. Any feedback on this feature would be greatly appreciated.</p>

		<p>This is the exciting first installment of the Weekly Featured Swap! Every week we will pick a swap that we believe is a great example of an interesting, fun, and well-organized swap. We will make sure the featured swap is open for sign-up through the following week.</p>

<p><img alt="yarnball1.jpg" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/yarnball1.jpg" class="alignleft" />This week’s featured swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/1708">Magic Yarn Ball</a> swap coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4512">Katy</a>. This is a great swap for people who would love to receive (and send!) yarn that could be used in knitting or crocheting projects. The swap is marked US only and has a few other restrictions, so please read the entire description before signing up. (Also, we just implemented a new feature which allows coordinators to check over the final list of participants and ban anyone they need to before partners are assigned, so make sure you meet all of the requirements.)</p>

<p>So, what exac</p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://getyourextips.com/" title="get your ex back">get your ex back</a>
</div>

<p>tly is a magic yarn ball? Katy describes them likes this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically, you wrap cool little treasures up in a ball of yarn, and give it as a gift. As the recipient crafts with the yarn the treasures fall out one by one, and they discover the fun as they knit or crochet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img alt="yarnball2.jpg" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/yarnball2.jpg" class="alignleft" />It sounds like a lot of fun! There are all sort of little trinkets and treasures you could include in your magic yarn ball for your swap partner to discover, like buttons, candy, beads, little figurines, fabric, ribbon, toys, etc… Anything small and playful that your partner will be delighted to see unraveling from their ball of yarn</p>

<p>And for those of you who live in Europe, there is a Europe-only <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/1687">Valentine Magic Yarn Ball Swap</a> coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2661">Lixie</a>. This swap is open through the end of the month, so make sure to check it out!</p>

<p>Swap-bot finally has a new look! We remodeled the home page and added a rotating selection of images from <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> that all have the tag “swapbot”. Check it out! (If you still want to see the original home page, don’t worry, it is right <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/info.php">here</a>.) The rest of Swap-bot is still pretty much the same… with the addition of the awesome new messaging system.</p>

<p>Your faithful and intrepid <a href="http://www.eightfivethree.com/">Swap-bot webmaster</a> is busy working on lots of new ideas for the site. Look for updates in the swap search system and the swap image gallery in the near future.</p>

		<p>We just released some great new features for Swap-bot!</p>

<p>You can now send Messages to all of your buddies and swap partners via the Swap-bot web messaging system. Now, when you contact other members a message is sent to their inbox on Swap-bot.com. After logging in, you can check your messages by clicking on the link at the top of the Swap-bot page.</p>

<p>In order to cut down on bad swappers signing up for swaps at the last minute (when it is too late for coordinators to ban them), we have made it so that every coordinator has a chance to check over the final list of swap participants before partners are assigned. It is now the coordinators’ responsibility to initiate the partner assignment process. See <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php#question17">question 17 of the FAQs</a> for more info.</p>

<p>You might have also noticed that the Swap-bot Blog got a little face-lift. We are planning on updating this blog MUCH more often about changes and updates to swap-bot. I am also going to start featuring a cool swap every week on the blog. Look for the “Weekly Featured Swap” to be posted every Sunday.</p>

<p>We hope you like the new features! Please keep us posted about things you would like to see on Swap-bot. We love to hear your feedback!<u style="display:none">[City of Joy buy](http://utero.pe/?city_of_joy)</u></p>
