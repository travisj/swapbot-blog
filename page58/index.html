The swap is a bit detailed, so I will quote the requirements directly from the excellent swap description:</p>

<p><em>“In this swap you will create 1 matchbox for 1 partner based on one of their favorite books. Use the 32-count size</em> [free template ] <em>and make the outside of the matchbox look like the book – it doesn’t have to look like the actual cover (unless you are really creative, that would be awesome!) but it does have to look like a book. It must have the title of the book you choose. Fill the inside with items that relate to the book. For instance (I’m just using this as an example because it’s so well known) for</em> Twilight <em>you could put in a tiny fang, something to represent blood drops, an apple bead for the cover? Try to find at least 3-5 items that represent the book. You can make them if you wish. If you can’t fill the matchbox up with those things, add some brads and buttons and ribbon, etc in the color scheme and fill it to the brim!”</em></p>

<p>To join the , you must have completed at least five previous craft swaps and have no 1 or 3 ratings. You also need to have a healthy listing of favorite books on your profile page so that your sending partner will know what type of matchbox to create.</p>

<p>The swap is international and you must get signed up before October 15th. I think this swap is such a fun and unique idea! I am going to get signed up right now…</p>

						<p>I have few more fantastic Ernie the Envie (Swap-bot’s envelope logo mascot) craft creations to share…</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/erniefascinatoratc.jpg" alt="erniefascinatoratc" title="erniefascinatoratc" width="470" height="245" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2672" /></p>

<p>This ATC (titled <em>Ernie Goes to Argentina</em>) and felt “fascinator” (which can be used as a brooch or decoration) were created by for the . I love how Ernie is on top of a pile of mail in each of the items. So cute and true to life! <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>For the same swap, I received this Ernie postcard and Swap-bot-themed matchbox from :</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/scrapkween.jpg" alt="scrapkween" title="scrapkween" width="470" height="366" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2673" /></p>

<p>The matchbox is displayed in a place of prominence at Swap-bot HQ!</p>

<p>The following items were not made for a specific swap, but instead were created by VJP to include as little extras in her swap packages. They are the most amazing Ernie and Evie themed charms. (Evie is Ernie’s new pink girlfriend created by .) I really like how the charms are coated in a clear epoxy – very fancy!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/vickischarms.jpg" alt="vickischarms" title="vickischarms" width="470" height="293" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2675" /></p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who has shared their Swap-bot-themed creations. I am always looking for more to include here on the blog. If you have a craft to share, please email me at rachel [at] swap-bot.com with your photos!</p>

The swap is international and open to anyone with a 4.9 rating, or higher. It is really simple and speedy – after all, Halloween is fast approaching and I want to fit in one more spooky holiday-themed craft swap before it comes and goes.</p>

<p>Each participant will create and fill one 32-count matchbox in a Halloween theme for their one partner. Halloween-themed can be anything from ghosts and goblins to fall leaves to witches and monsters… really anything that reminds you of Halloween is fair game! Like always, you can download my free matchbox template PDFs . Anyone and everyone who enjoys Halloween is invited to come sign up before October 11th!</p>

<p>Here is an example of a matchbox I made for a similar swap in the past:</p>

The swap is open for sign up until September 30th, but make sure to read the before joining! Have fun!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Linda50"><strong>Linda50</strong></a>: <em>“My favorite ATC is one that I received from my sister. She is the person that told me about Swap-bot and she knew it would be good for me. She was so right. Here is a to her ATC. ATC’s are so much fun to do and to receive. I am glad that ATC’s are something that everyone that wants to can do. You do not have to have a ton of supplies and they are not expensive to mail. Just about the perfect little mail art project. Looking thru my ATC album is almost like looking thru a family album. As I look at them I remember who made them and a little about the person as well.”</em></p>

<p><strong>AndreaSmondria</strong><em>&lt;/a&gt;: “my favorite atc that i made was for the i love the 80’s swap, it was of the flock of seagull hair style. it turned out great and i really didn’t want to part with it. But i did and my partner loved it also.”</em> &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Congratulations to the winners! Thank you to everyone for entering. Stay tuned because there will be more giveaways happening in the near future… (hint: have you seen the ? very cool.)</p>

						<p>I received my first email with a photo of an item made for the the other day. created this adorable Ernie stuffie and keychain:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ernies.jpg" alt="ernies" title="ernies" width="470" height="380" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2631" /></p>

<p>Both are magnificent, but I have a soft spot in my heart for the mini keychain – so cute!</p>

<p>For the same swap, I made the Ernie matchbox below (he is glittery) and some personalized swap cards for my partner. (Stay tuned for a free Ernie swap card download in the near future!)</p>
