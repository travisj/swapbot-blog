		<p>This week’s featured swap, , is a truly unique and happy swap. The international swap is hosted by and it is open to anyone (with no recent 1 or 3 ratings) who wants to hear good news from around the world. Here are the swap directions from the :</p>

<p><em>“I guess we’re all tired of reading about bad news on the newspapers – murders, violence, wars – so what about sending to your swap partner a journal full of GOOD and HAPPY news taken from your local/national newspapers? That’s what you have to do: you’ll collect as much newspapers’ cuttings as you can and stick them into a journal/notebook, then send it to your swap partner. It’s quite cheap because you only have to buy a journal, but you can also make it on your own. If you read non-English newspapers, you can translate only the article’s title or the whole article if it’s short. The articles MUST talk about GOOD, HAPPY, NICE, or FUNNY things.”</em></p>

<p>The swap sign up deadline for is October 25th, but the mail deadline is not until January 23rd. That gives you plenty of time to collect lots of feel-good news stories for your partner. What a great way to stay positive and focused on the good things that happen in the world everyday!</p>

<p>When you next log into Swap-bot, you may notice two new additions to the Dashboard.</p>

<p>First, we have added a drop down menu under the Dashboard link so that you can get to your different swap lists more quickly.</p>

<p>Second, we have created a new list within your Dashboard just for your hosted swaps. All of the current and previous swaps that you have hosted will be listed there. If you have not hosted any swaps, you will not have a “Hosting” Dashboard section.</p>

<p>We still have a lot of work to do on the site navigation and organization, but this is one small step in the right direction! Enjoy!</p>

The swap is a bit detailed, so I will quote the requirements directly from the excellent swap description:</p>

<p><em>“In this swap you will create 1 matchbox for 1 partner based on one of their favorite books. Use the 32-count size</em> [free template ] <em>and make the outside of the matchbox look like the book – it doesn’t have to look like the actual cover (unless you are really creative, that would be awesome!) but it does have to look like a book. It must have the title of the book you choose. Fill the inside with items that relate to the book. For instance (I’m just using this as an example because it’s so well known) for</em> Twilight <em>you could put in a tiny fang, something to represent blood drops, an apple bead for the cover? Try to find at least 3-5 items that represent the book. You can make them if you wish. If you can’t fill the matchbox up with those things, add some brads and buttons and ribbon, etc in the color scheme and fill it to the brim!”</em></p>

<p>To join the , you must have completed at least five previous craft swaps and have no 1 or 3 ratings. You also need to have a healthy listing of favorite books on your profile page so that your sending partner will know what type of matchbox to create.</p>

<p>The swap is international and you must get signed up before October 15th. I think this swap is such a fun and unique idea! I am going to get signed up right now…</p>

		<p>I have few more fantastic Ernie the Envie (Swap-bot’s envelope logo mascot) craft creations to share…</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/erniefascinatoratc.jpg" alt="erniefascinatoratc" title="erniefascinatoratc" width="470" height="245" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2672" /></p>

<p>This ATC (titled <em>Ernie Goes to Argentina</em>) and felt “fascinator” (which can be used as a brooch or decoration) were created by for the . I love how Ernie is on top of a pile of mail in each of the items. So cute and true to life! <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>For the same swap, I received this Ernie postcard and Swap-bot-themed matchbox from :</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/scrapkween.jpg" alt="scrapkween" title="scrapkween" width="470" height="366" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2673" /></p>

<p>The matchbox is displayed in a place of prominence at Swap-bot HQ!</p>

<p>The following items were not made for a specific swap, but instead were created by VJP to include as little extras in her swap packages. They are the most amazing Ernie and Evie themed charms. (Evie is Ernie’s new pink girlfriend created by .) I really like how the charms are coated in a clear epoxy – very fancy!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/vickischarms.jpg" alt="vickischarms" title="vickischarms" width="470" height="293" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2675" /></p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who has shared their Swap-bot-themed creations. I am always looking for more to include here on the blog. If you have a craft to share, please email me at rachel [at] swap-bot.com with your photos!</p>

The swap is international and open to anyone with a 4.9 rating, or higher. It is really simple and speedy – after all, Halloween is fast approaching and I want to fit in one more spooky holiday-themed craft swap before it comes and goes.</p>

<p>Each participant will create and fill one 32-count matchbox in a Halloween theme for their one partner. Halloween-themed can be anything from ghosts and goblins to fall leaves to witches and monsters… really anything that reminds you of Halloween is fair game! Like always, you can download my free matchbox template PDFs . Anyone and everyone who enjoys Halloween is invited to come sign up before October 11th!</p>

<p>Here is an example of a matchbox I made for a similar swap in the past:</p>

<p>Bottle cap pincushions are just what they sound like – mini handmade pincushions that are constructed using the twist cap from a soda bottle.

However, the pincushion should be in the color of your recipient’s choice. The swap is international and open to swappers with a 4.9 overall rating, or higher, and new users who have a full profile. The swap is open for sign up until September 30th, but make sure to read the before joining! Have fun!</p>
