		<p><strong>MARKDOWN TUTORIAL</strong> by Deana Barker (<a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:muincat">muincat</a>)</p>

<p>These days, it seems just about every Swap-Bot Forum I go into, someone has a question about how to change their profile, whether it be to add a badge, picture, link or whatever. Usually, the person doesn’t know a thing about Markdown language and is asking for help. I never ran across Markdown until I became a member of Swap Bot and it frustrated me at first, too. I followed the link provided by Swap-Bot to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">Daring Fireball: Markdown Basics</a>, but still found it difficult to work out what to do without specific examples pertinent to Swap-Bot, so that’s what I’m going to try to do for you all here in this post. With any luck, we’ll have you off into the land of customizing bliss in no time!</p>

<p><strong>PICTURES &amp; BADGES:</strong></p>

<p>This is the one I see the most questions on. “How can I add this badge/picture to my profile?”</p>

<p>Well, badges and pictures are really the same thing. First, you need to know the location of the image you want to use. It has to already be uploaded online somewhere since Swap-Bot does not have the capability of uploading graphics for profiles.</p>

<p>Let’s say I want to post the “I Pledge To Rate” badge created by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pgk">pgk</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/purplebadge.jpg" alt="I pledge to rate" title="pledge badge" width="103" height="107" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-810" /></p>

<p>This badge is located on the Swap-bot server at: http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg – In the case of most badges, however, the image location information will be provided for you by whomever created the badge. The graphics may be located on Photobucket, or Flickr, or on someone’s personal website. The location will always need to be an internet URL address – not a link to your personal computer.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll go into “Edit Profile” and decide where you want this badge to show up on your profile. When you find the spot, click on it, so that your cursor is in that spot, ready to type.</p>

<p>What you type to make the image appear on your profile page (the reason you’re all reading this!):</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>

<p>If you want to get fancy and add a description for folks who might not be able to load graphics for whatever reason, you would type something like this:</p>

<p><strong>![alt text](http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg)</strong></p>

<p>Lets say you want “alt text” to read “I pledge to rate.” It would look like this:</p>

<p><strong>![I Pledge to Rate](http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg)</strong></p>

<p>———-</p>

<p>You add other types of photos and pictures exactly the same way! How cool is that?! Let’s pretend you’ve got this really cute animated clip art you want on your profile, like this little kitty:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dancincat.gif" alt="dancincat" title="dancincat" width="95" height="100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-812" /></p>

<p>You would need to have him available somewhere online, like Flikr, Photobucket or your own personal website. I uploaded this little guy to my web server so I could show you how to do it. He is located at http://www.muincat.com/images/DancinCat.gif, so I would would find the place in my profile where I wanted to put him and type:</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.muincat.com/images/DancinCat.gif" alt="" /></strong></p>

<p>OR</p>

<p><strong>![Dancing Kitty](http://www.muincat.com/images/DancinCat.gif)</strong></p>

<p>———-</p>

<p><strong>MAKING HYPERLINKS:</strong></p>

<p>Great news! Hyperlinks are made the same way! The only difference is that you’re linking to a website instead of a picture file. Going back to the “I Pledge to Rate” example, you could put a link under the page that goes to the webpage that explains exactly what it is that you pledged like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/7681">What I Pledged</a></p>

<p>To make a link you type the words you would like hyperlinked in brackets, followed by the URL in parenthesis:</p>

<p><strong>[What I Pledged](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/7681)</strong></p>

<p>The whole thing with the graphic and link would look like this:</p>

<p>**![I Pledge to Rate](http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>[What I Pledged](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/7681) &lt;/b&gt;</p>

<p>If you want to only post the graphic and make it a link, your code would look like this:</p>

<p><strong>[<img src="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/7681" alt="I Pledge to Rate](http://static.swap-bot.com/purplebadge.jpg)" /></strong></p>

<p>Another example would be if you wanted to make a link to your Amazon Wish List. Find the place in your profile that you’d like to add the link. You’d like it to say <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1QLOE6JUSKNJ2">This is my Amazon Wishlist</a> . Type:</p>

<p><strong>[This is my Amazon Wish List](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1QLOE6JUSKNJ2)</strong></p>

<p>Just make sure you type YOUR wish list URL and not the one above, since its mine. But then again, if you’d like the whole world to send me gifts from Amazon, I’m fine with that! 😉</p>

<p>———</p>

<p><strong>OTHER FORMATTING:</strong></p>

<p>OK, pictures and links are the two biggest things that everyone wants to do. There are, however, a few other things that can make things look nice.</p>

<p>If you’d like to make a</p>

<h2 id="big-headline">Big Headline</h2>

<p>(Heading 1), just type equal signs under it like so:</p>

<p>Big Headline</p>

<p>==========</p>

<p>If you’d like a</p>

<h1 id="smaller-headline">Smaller Headline</h1>

<p>(Heading 2), like for a subcategory, just type dashes on the line under it like so:</p>

<p>Smaller Headline</p>

<p>————————</p>

<p>The next level down is considered</p>

<h3 id="heading-3">Heading 3</h3>

<p>and would be typed with 3 pound signs before it like this:</p>

<p>###Heading 3</p>

<p>Bulleted lists are probably the easiest thing of all to make. All you have to do is put an asterisk before each item in the list and it will make it for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Item 1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Item 2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Item 3</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Gives you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want a numbered list, just do the same as above, but use a number with a period after it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Item</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another Item</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Gives You:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Item</li>
  <li>Another Item</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’d like to make something show up in <em>italics</em> on your profile, all you have to do is add an asterisk on either side of the word or phrase you’d like emphasized. If you want something written in <strong>bold</strong>, use TWO asterisks on both sides of the word or phrase.</p>

<p>———-</p>

<p>Last, but not least, the “Preview” button is your friend! If you’re not sure that you typed something correctly, just hit the preview button and you’ll be able to check your work. Also, you can go to the code generator at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus">Daring Fireball</a> to do a trial run. The first box is where you type what you want to try. Below the box, you’ll find two drop down menus. Leave the first one (“Filter”) set to “Markdown” and the “Results” drop down should be set to “Preview.” Click “Convert” and the next box shows you what it will really look like to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p><em>Thank you to Deana for such a detailed and helpful tutorial! We (Travis &amp; Rachel) chose to allow Markdown (as opposed to HTML) on Swap-bot for formatting because it helps keep the site safe from HTML code which could cause problems. Markdown is also meant to be a simpler language that is easier to learn. You can use any of the formatting options discussed above on your profile page, within swap descriptions, and within the Swap-bot Forums. There is more helpful information about using Markdown on the <a href="http://swap-bot.pbworks.com/formatting+and+linking+on+swap-bot">Swap-bot Wiki</a>. Have fun!</em></p>

		<p>Creating a descriptive profile page is an important part of swapping on Swap-bot, but what does that entail? And, how do you make your profile fabulous?</p>

<p>The Swap-bot “Edit Profile” page is extremely simple in design, but it allows you endless possibilities for customization. The “Personal” link at the top of the “Edit Profile” page is where you go to add information to your profile page.</p>

<p>&lt;img style=”border:1px solid black;” src=”http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/editprofile-300x155.jpg” alt=”Click on Edit Profile “ title=”Click on Edit Profile “ width=”300” height=”155” class=”size-medium wp-image-791” “ srcset=”http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/editprofile-300x155.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/editprofile.jpg 377w” sizes=”(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px” /&gt;</p>

<p>Once you are there, follow these tips:</p>

<p><strong>First, Add URLs</strong></p>

<p>This is where you can prominently place links to other places on the internet that you inhabit, such as your blog(s), your MySpace Profile, your Flickr Photos, and if you’re an indie artist who sells your work, links to your Etsy store, your Artfire studio, etc. If you have wishlists on other sites, you can also add those links. Swap-bot provides a dropdown list with a few of these titles for the links, including My Amazon Wishlist, but you must provide the correct link address. For the wishlists, make sure you are not logged in on that site when you copy the link address or it won’t work for other people. If what you want to link to isn’t on the drop down list, just click on “other” and Swap-bot lets you name the link what you want, such as My Etsy Faves.</p>

<p><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/personal-300x195.jpg" alt="" title="Add URLs" width="300" height="195" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-792" /></p>

<p><strong>Second, Add info about yourself</strong></p>

<p>The “Profile Edit” page starts out only showing one profile section, but you can add additional sections to your profile by clicking the “Add Another” link. You can choose from the pre-set section titles, or create your own by selecting “Other” and typing in a title.</p>

<p><img style="border:1px solid black;" src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/aboutme-300x256.jpg" alt="" title="Add info about yourself" width="300" height="256" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-793" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/aboutme-300x256.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/aboutme.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

<p>Following are some suggestions for what to include in each section:</p>

<ul>
  <li>About me</li>
</ul>

<p>This is where you give people a general idea of who you are. You can include things like your job, a bit about your family, your hobbies and so on. You could include information about whether you would like to do one-on-one swaps with others, or if you are interested in specialized swaps. Add as much info as you would like, but remember that Swap-bot profiles are public, so do not include anything that you do not want to be public knowledge.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Favourite crafts</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do enjoy crafting, describe your projects here. Do you crochet, sew, are you interested in paper crafts, ATCs? If you are mainly interested in postcard or letter swaps, you can skip this section. You do not have to include all (or any) of the pre-set sections in your profile – they are simply suggestions to get you started.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Favorite books/videos/music</li>
</ul>

<p>These are pretty self-explanatory sections. If you do love movies, books, tv or music, you can give them each their own area on your profile page. The type of info included in these sections may not affect the swap packages that your partners send, but it will help them get to know you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Other sections</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no limit to what other sections you can add to your profile. Some users have added sections specifically about their family members, or about special collections they have. You can create an area for anything you would like to share about your self on your profile page.</p>

<p>A lot of swapbot users list their likes and dislikes under special sections. These two categories of info are very important for profile-specific swaps and swaps where your partner is likely to go looking for making that special thing for you. Your partner will get inspiration and maybe find information about what little extras you might like. The more information you include, the better are your chances of receiving a parcel you really like. You could list things like your favorite colors, craft materials, candy, and other items you would like to receive. It is equally important to list your dislikes. Include any allergies or intolerances you may have to things.</p>

<p>You can also create a section to discuss how you handle swapping in general. The section can include statements about rating, being rated, how and when you send swaps, and what you do if you dont receive a swap.</p>

<p>Have fun adding “other” information to your profile page! Make it a place where others can quickly get to know you.</p>

<p><strong>Adding Images and graphics</strong></p>

<p>You are not required to add images and graphic to your profile, but some members have a lot of fun customizing their page. If you want to decorate your profile, you must first upload your graphic somewhere online (like on flickr or photobucket) and then you can use Markdown code to link to the images for display on your profile page. There is more information about using Markdown on the Swap-bot wiki, <a href="http://swap-bot.pbworks.com/formatting+and+linking+on+swap-bot">here</a>. Also, stay tuned for a handy Markdown tutorial on an upcoming Tuesday Tip post!</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CherylLaVon">CherylLaVon</a> , an active Swap-bot member, a lover of Dotee Dolls, and a good friend to many on Swap-bot, passed away yesterday after a long illness. Instead of a featured swap this week, I want to draw attention to some projects you can do in honor of Cheryl.</p>

<p>If you would like to send a card to Cheryl’s family, user <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Fairy20tails">Fairy20tails</a> is collecting them to send as a group. Please read her <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/35387">forum thread</a> for more info.</p>

<p>A swap, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/37378">In Honor of CherylLaVon</a> , has been created by user <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TheFallenAngel">TheFallenAngel</a>. For the swap users are asked to donate to <a href="http://main.acsevents.org/site/TR/Events/MosaicofHope?pg=fund&amp;fr_id=9910&amp;pxfid=511453">Cheryl’s American Cancer Society Memorial Fund</a>, add their memories of her to the memorial page, and send a card to her family via Fairy20Tails. Swap participants will not receive any items in the swap, but will be able to honor a friend and share their memories.</p>

<p>User <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:PGK">pgk</a> has also created a graphic in memory of Cheryl that you can place on your profile page. You can find it on this <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/35409/3">forum page</a> .</p>

<p>Cheryl will be greatly missed on Swap-bot, but it is wonderful to see so many of her friends honoring her life and memory. &lt;/u&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;</p>

		<p>Creating and running a swap on Swap-bot is a lot of fun, but it is also a big responsibility. Here are some important tips on how to run a successful swap:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Give a Detailed Description</strong> – When creating a swap make sure that you have clearly and thoroughly explained your swap idea. Include a description of the item(s) being swapped, an explanation of the craft technique being utilized (with links to instructional websites if needed), and a clear statement of what is expected from participants. A dollar value or number of items expected to be sent for the swap may be needed. Also, make sure you include what kind of requirements participants are expected to have, such as a completed profile, minimum rating, number of swaps completed, etc. The more detailed your description, the more likely you are to attract committed, quality swappers to your swap.</li>
  <li><strong>Create a Swap Graphic</strong> – A custom graphic or image for your swap is not required, but it does give your swap an identity and it shows that you are dedicated swap host.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate with Participants</strong> – Be available for any questions members may have via private message and email. Check your swap page periodically to read comments left by participants and respond if needed. Clearly and kindly explaining your expectations will help your swap run smoothly.</li>
  <li><strong>Check Over Participants</strong> – This may be the most important tip! After the sign up deadline for your swap has closed, carefully check over your list of participants and remove any user who does not meet your rating or region requirements, or who does not appear to be a strong swapper. Swap-bot is an open website which accepts all different types of people from all over the world. We believe diversity of culture and opinion strengthens and enriches the community, but it also means that there may be people on Swap-bot with whom you are not comfortable swapping. As swap coordinator, it is your duty to protect your swap participants from questionable or dishonest users. Swap-bot’s automatic suspension system and Admin are the first line of defense against questionable swappers, but we rely on our coordinators to be a second line of defense against swap lifting and other undesirable behavior. If you come across a user who makes you uncomfortable, remove them from your swap before assigning partners and report them to Swap-bot Admin (questions [at] swap-bot.com).</li>
  <li><strong>Send Your Swap</strong> &lt;/b&gt; – This is a no-brainer, but it is especially disappointing when a swap coordinator does not send their swap!</li>
  <li><strong>Follow up with your participants</strong> – About 2-3 weeks after the send date, follow up with your participants to see if everybody has sent and received their swap. You can email your participants as a group, or just look over the details on the swap’s participant page. You may choose to angel your swap or arrange angels, if needed. Make sure to remind any swappers who did not receive a swap to rate their sending partner honestly with a 1 rating. Honest ratings help weed out the dishonest users more quickly. If you had any major problems with any of your participants, report them to Swap-bot Admin (questions [at] swap-bot.com).</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are some of my general tips for how to be a good swap coordinator, but what else makes a coordinator extra special? What tips do you have for first time coordinators?</p>

		<p>I really wish there was a picture to go along with this week’s featured swap, because when I read the title I literally shrieked out loud! The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/34799">Matchbox Backpack on a Dotee swap</a>, hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Charrley">Charrley</a>, sounds like it will be a ton of adorable fun. For the swap, each participant creates a Dotee Doll of any theme for their one partner. They then alter a 32-count matchbox to be a tiny backpack for the doll. The “backpack” must contain at least five craft items that the recipient can use in future projects. The swap is international and you must sign up before May 24th.</p>

<p>Dotee Dolls are small fabric dolls created by Dorothy “Dot” Christian. They are meant to spread friendship, love, and joy. For more info about Dotee Dolls, <a href="http://dotslifeandart.blogspot.com/2008/01/dotee-doll-fervour.html">check out their creator, Dot’s, blog</a>. You can also see lots of great photos of the dolls in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/doteedolls/">Dotee Doll Flickr group</a>. View the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/matchboxcrafts/">Matchbox Crafts Flickr group</a> to see lots of inspirational altered matchboxes. I can’t wait to see photos from the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/34799">Matchbox Backpack on a Dotee swap</a> in those Flickr groups!!</p>
