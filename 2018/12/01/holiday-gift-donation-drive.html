<p><strong>Did you know? Over 25,000 children are sleeping in New York City homeless shelters tonight.</strong></p>

<p>It is that time of year again when we can help brighten the holiday season for some of NYC’s homeless youth. Help us by donating to our 9th Annual Holiday Gift Donation Drive to benefit <a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org">The Partnership for the Homeless</a>! <img src="/images/2016/redstripe2.gif" alt="stripes!" /></p>

<p>The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services, support, and advocacy for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate our donations of new, unwrapped gifts and gift cards to be handed out to children at their Children’s Holiday Party in Brooklyn on December 8th, 2018.</p>

<p><strong>A message from The Partnership for the Homeless:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your generosity will bring smiles to the faces of 200 children! We thank you in advance for your support and look forward to your continued sponsorship as we put on our annual Holiday Party for these children and their families.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This year we are expecting even more children to attend the party. The day will be magical for these children with music, games, crafts, face painting, tasty food and even a picture with Santa! We hope that this will result in an abundance of laughter and fond memories.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is our goal to send each child home with toys, games, clothes and books, but more importantly, a smile from ear to ear! These “gifts from Santa” are only possible through donations, toy drives and the generous spirit of our contributors. As a non-profit, we depend on people like you, to help us make this a truly special afternoon.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope that once again, we can count on your participation in spreading holiday joy!”</p>

<p>Let’s put together a huge donation of gifts for The Partnership!!</p>

<p>Our donation drive will have a shorter timeline this year. Your donation must be received by November 30th, 2018, so please consider donating as soon as possible. To streamline the process this year, online PayPal donations are the best option. We will use your Paypal donations to purchase gift cards for distribution at The Partnership for the Homeless Children’s Holiday Party on December 8th, 2018, OR to make a direct donation to The Partnership, depending on their greater need. Use the link below to donate OR send Paypal donations to rachel@swap-bot.com. All Paypal donations of $10 or more will count toward a rating removal.</p>

<p><strong>Click here to donate via <a href="https://www.paypal.me/swapbot">PayPal</a>.</strong></p>

<p>We can ALSO accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $10 or $20 amounts to stores like Target, Barnes and Noble, H&amp;M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Best Buy. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC. Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless because they are versatile and good for older kids, but we can also accept new, unwrapped toys, books, and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations.</p>

<p>Please mail any physical donations by Friday, November 30th, 2018, to:</p>

<p><strong>Rachel Johnson Swap-bot.com 516 68th St. Brooklyn, NY 11220</strong></p>

<p>And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: Each Swap-bot member who sends in a donation of a gift card or item will earn the removal of one low (1 or 3) rating from their account!! You must mail your donation to Swap-bot headquarters (address above) by Friday, November 30th, 2018. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will receive a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only earn one rating removal credit during this donation drive –- although you are welcome to donate more than one item or more than $10!</p>

<p>The Fine Print: All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings — it is not a “free pass” for flaking. Everyone who donates will receive an email from me with the details of the rating removal credit. You can reply to that message any time to “cash in” your credit. I also make a permanent admin note (only visible to admin) on each donor’s account stating that they have a rating removal credit.</p>

<p>As always, let me know if you have any questions.</p>
