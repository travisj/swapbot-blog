I am very excited to announce the new layout of the [profile pages](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4)! We spent quite a while trying to decide how to organize all of the things that we wanted to include on the pages, and we finally settled on an arrangement that we hope you like&#8230;

You will now notice that in the upper right corner there is a designated ratings box. Here you will find the user&#8217;s average rating, their number of hearts, and soon you will be able to see their number of stars. Stars will be used to indicate exceptional swap coordination (for hosts/hostesses), but that feature is not ready quite yet.

The full list of a user&#8217;s ratings is still located at the bottom of the profile information, but there is one exciting addition to the ratings &#8211; you can now RESPOND to any rating given to you! Your response will show up in a gray box beneath the rating. Many users have been requesting this feature for a while, and I am very excited to see how it works out.

Another exciting new feature we added to the profiles is a comment section. Here any Swap-bot users can leave comments on your profile. It is separate from the messaging system and we thought it would be a great way for swappers to thank their partners in a semi-public way. It is also an easy way to communicate.

We know that there may be a few bugs to work out on the new profile pages, so please notify us if you see anything weird. Also, the profile pages are now 910 pixels wide, meaning that some of you using lower resolution computer screens may have to scroll horizontally to see the whole thing. We are sorry about that inconvenience, but there was just no way to include so much info in such a small area. All in all we hope you love the new layout and enjoy the new features. We will continually try to improve and update Swap-bot to make it more fun and easy to use. xoxo

UPDATE: I forgot to add an explanation about the lists of &#8220;Currently In&#8221; and &#8220;Currently Hosting&#8221; swaps (On the right side of the new profile pages). The &#8220;Currently In&#8221; list shows all of the swaps you are currently signed up for in which you have NOT yet marked as sent. The &#8220;Currently Hosting&#8221; list contains all of the swaps you coordinated that have not closed yet. Meaning that other swapper can still sign up for them.<em style="display:none"></em>
