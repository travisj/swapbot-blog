While visiting the tiny island town of [Stonington, Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonington,_Maine), last week, I spied their picturesque Post Office and had to share the photos.

The lobster fishing town has about 1,000 residents, a beautiful view of the sea, and a cute main street. Even more remote is the nearby island of [Isle au Haut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_au_Haut,_Maine), that is only reachable twice a day by mail boat from Stonington!
