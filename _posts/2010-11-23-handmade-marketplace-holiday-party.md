I&#8217;m in a turkey type of mood this week! Here, in the US, our Thanksgiving holiday is on Thursday, so I&#8217;ve been thinking about food, family, and fun holiday get-togethers. My Etsy picks this week are a rough assortment of holiday party-related items. (Above are [laser-cut, felt coasters](http://www.etsy.com/listing/62784069/eat-drink-and-be-merry-set-of-four-felt) from [peppersprouts](http://www.etsy.com/shop/peppersprouts?ref=pr_profile), a fellow Brooklynite.) Enjoy!
