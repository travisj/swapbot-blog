Usually, I try to highlight international swaps that everyone can participate in, but this week I am featuring a USA-only swap. In the US, our general elections are coming up on November 2nd, so this week&#8217;s featured swap is the [Vote on November 2nd! A Postcard Reminder swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74251) hosted by [melusina](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:melusina). 

This postcard swap is quite easy, but it will help to spread the message that voting is important no matter what your politics. Simply mail one postcard to your one partner &#8211; the postcard must have an image that will help remind others to vote on November 2nd. The recipient of the postcard can then hang it in a public location as a voting reminder. 

Sign up for the [Vote on Nov. 2nd swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74251) by this Friday, October 15th. It is a great way to help get ourselves and others involved in our democracy!
