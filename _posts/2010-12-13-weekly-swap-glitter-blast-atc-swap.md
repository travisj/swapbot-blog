I am a sucker for glitter! It seems even more appropriate during the holidays&#8230; 

If you are a glitter lover like me, you may want to join the [Glitter Blast ATC Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/79087) hosted by [bratface99](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:bratface99). 

The swap is international and pretty self-explanitory&#8230; Make one Artist Trading Card using glitter in some way for each of your two partners. The ATCs must be normal size &#8211; 2.5 x 3.5 inches &#8211; but other than that, you can interpret the theme any way you&#8217;d like. Sign up for the swap before December 24th, and send your ATCs before January 7th. [Read the swap description](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/79087) for all the details.
