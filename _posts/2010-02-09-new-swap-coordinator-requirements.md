We have finally released the new swap coordinator requirements that were previously discussed in the forums . We made these changes to the requirements after receiving a lot of user input about who should be able to host a swap on Swap-bot. These changes will probably not affect any long-time users, but they will change how and when new users can host swaps.

Starting now, you must meet these requirements in order to create any swap:

  * You must complete five different swaps (i.e. send and mark five swaps as sent).
  * You must have received five 5 ratings (they can be for the same swap, or different swaps).
  * You must have LESS than ten 1 ratings in your entire Swap-bot lifetime.

And, like always:

  * You must have over a 3.0 average rating.
  * You must NOT be suspended in any way (partially of fully) or be underage.

Any swaps that are already underway will not be affected by this change. I believe these new restrictions will help increase the overall average quality level of swaps hosted on Swap-bot. These restrictions are not perfect &#8211; other types of restrictions have been suggested, like restricting each type of swap individually &#8211; but I think they are a good start. They are much more strict than the previous requirement of just completing one swap!

Like always, we can override these restrictions if there are new users who have past swapping experience and would like to start hosting on Swap-bot. We still want Swap-bot to be a helpful tool for those who host successful swaps on their blogs, so I will continue to make exceptions for those types of swaps as needed.

Also, these restrictions are probably a lot more lenient than what many Swap-bot users look for in their swap coordinators. Remember to always check out the swap&#8217;s host before signing up for a swap. You can set your own personal coordinator requirements and only join swaps hosted by users who meet them. A good swap host makes for a successful swap!
