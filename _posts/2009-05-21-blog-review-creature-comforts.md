I want to quickly share with you one of my absolute favorite blogs: [Creature Comforts](http://creaturecomforts.typepad.com/my_weblog/). The site is run by Ez, who loves style and design and all things beautiful. She features the most lovely photography and art each day by sharing her inspirations from all around the web. She also often has giveaways and [free downloads](http://creaturecomforts.typepad.com/photos/freebies_and_tutorials/) to share. It seems like all of my bookmarked websites these days have been found by reading Creature Comforts! 

You can check out Ez&#8217;s Etsy store, [Wren & Chickadee](http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5253898), and her [Twitter](http://twitter.com/creaturecomfort) . She is also one of the artists behind [Kindred](http://www.thekindredsite.com/).
