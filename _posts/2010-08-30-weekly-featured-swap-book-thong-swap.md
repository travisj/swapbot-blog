Have you ever heard of book thongs? They are bookmarks made out of a thin ribbon or string with beads or charms on either end. They are a pretty way to mark your spot in a book and they are easy to make! 

If you want to try making a few book thongs, join this week&#8217;s featured swap: the [Book Thong Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/70805), hosted by [craftsgalore](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:craftsgalore). The swap is international and open to those swappers with over a 4.8 rating. Sign up before September 10th, and then start working on your two book thongs. One will be sent to each of your two partners.
