Happy holiday season, everyone! Now is the time to fit in your holiday swapping before the season and the mail system gets too crazy. There are TONS of holiday-themed swaps available now, but I wanted to bring your attention to my two public holiday swaps:

**[Fun & Easy Holiday Card Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/187583)** &#8211; A simple, international, snail mail swap open to new & experienced users. Send (and receive) one store-bought or handmade holiday card to one partner. So easy! And it is a Top Swap! Sweet.

**[Holiday Fun Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/187577#comment-619662)** &#8211; An annual, international, paper crafting swap for experienced users with a 4.9 rating or higher. Craft a cute holiday-themed [matchbox](http://blog.swap-bot.com/rachels-matchbox-template/) and fill it with goodies for your one partner. 

Sign up for both swaps before this Friday, November 21st. Send your items before December 15th.
