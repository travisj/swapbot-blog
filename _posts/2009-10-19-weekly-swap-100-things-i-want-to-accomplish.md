I have never featured an electronic (email) swap here on the blog before, but with the current state of the economy I figure we can all appreciate a high-quality, but totally free swap. This week&#8217;s featured swap is the . The swap, which is hosted by , is international and open for sign up through October 30th. For the swap, you write a list of 100 things that you would like to do before you die, then you email that list to each of your five partners before November 8th. 

From the swap description:

_&#8220;I&#8217;ve had some really eye opening experiences in the last several months in my life and it got me thinking of things I would like to do in my life time. You know things you put off, or things you think heck I can&#8217;t do that, even things that you thought you could never do. But if suddenly you thought my gosh I may never be able to, wouldn&#8217;t you want a list and try to check off one thing as you go? I do &#8211; at least, I want to try.</p> 

So, I thought why not see what everyone else wants to do.This could be fun, it amazes me sometimes that others have the same ideas, but are afraid to mention them. The time to mention them is now.&#8221;</i> 

I like the idea of putting your goals on paper &#8211; it gives you a clearer picture of what you want out of life. This swap motivates you to do just that!
