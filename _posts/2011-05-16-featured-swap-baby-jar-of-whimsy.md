I forgot how much I love whimsy jar swaps! The photo above is of a jar I made for a [whimsy jar swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/33807) way back in 2009!

So, this week I chose the [Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Baby Jar Of Whimsy](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/90343) as the featured swap. The swap is hosted by [TECHGIRL10](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TECHGIRL10) and it is international. (But she is also hosting a [USA-only version](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/90330).)

Whimsy jars are little glass jars full of tiny trinkets and craft supplies. You can see some examples [here](http://www.google.com/search?q=whimsy+jar&hl=en&prmd=ivns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&ei=t2HDTd-5Mo_Atge32vyLBA&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&cd=2&ved=0CAsQ_AUoAQ&biw=1501&bih=651) and TECHGIRL10 has some amazing ones in her [Flickr stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/techgirl10/). For this swap you can use a baby food jar (approximately 2.5 ozs.) and fill full of fun tidbits. The swap is sender&#8217;s choice so you can create your jar around any theme, but the jar must be decorated and filled to the top. Keep in mind that a lot of tiny items can fit even in a small jar, so be prepared to include dozens of items. 

All participants must have a rating of 4.8 or above, with no unexplained 1&#8217;s or 3&#8217;s. The swap is not open to new users because you must have at least ten type 3 swaps. Be sure to read the full [swap description](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/90343) before signing up.
