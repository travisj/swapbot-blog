I started posting handmade marketplace picks **three years ago** with my [first post showcasing some fun snail mail-themed Etsy picks](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/04/06/new-feature-handmade-marketplace-picks/). There is so much fun handmade stuff out there, I thought it was time to revisit the mail theme&#8230;

The buttons above feature bird postage stamps from all over the world. Swap-bot member [TangleCrafts](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TangleCrafts) created them as part of the special [Project Dissimulation](http://tanglecrafts.wordpress.com/projectd2013/) she is working on:

_&#8220;I designed Project Dissimulation as a distraction when my dad was recently diagnosed with bowel cancer, but I hope it will allow me to help in some small way, too. The entire cover price from the sale of these badges will be donated to [Beating Bowel Cancer](http://www.beatingbowelcancer.org) &#8211; a charity with a very positive approach to bowel cancer awareness.&#8221;_ 

Check out her [zines](http://www.etsy.com/listing/127763985/a-dissimulation-of-birds-with-badge?ref=shop_home_active), too! Very cool and for a great cause!
