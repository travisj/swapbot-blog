This week&#8217;s featured swap is unique, but oh, so practical! The [Tea Wallet plus Tea swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/92765) is being hosted by [snowqueen1426](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:snowqueen1426). For the swap you must send your partner one sewn tea wallet, two wrapped tea bags, and a short message. 

For the wallet: </i>&#8220;You will sew not glue your wallet. Quality construction, made by you, that you are proud of&#8230;Use clean materials, with your choice of embellishments. The wallet should be able to store two or more packets of tea. The design, and colors will be senders choice.&#8221;</i>

This swap is regional and restricted to only those with a US address. Usually, I like to feature international swaps so that anyone can participate, but I really like the idea of tea wallets and hope this inspires similar swaps. 

Sign up for the [Tea Wallet plus Tea swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/92765) by June 18th. All US swappers who have completed ten Type 3 swaps and have a rating of 4.9 or higher are welcome! Read the swap description for the full details.
