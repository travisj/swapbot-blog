I love graffiti. I know that it is controversial because it can harm property, but I love the diversity of street art and the unique messages that the artists choose to express. I do not produce graffiti, but I do photograph it when I get a chance. (I took these two photos while out and about in New York.) 

If you are also interested in graffiti or street art, join this week&#8217;s featured swap: [**Graffiti Postcards**](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/97595). The international swap is hosted by [kankalin](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kankalin) and it consists of sending handmade graffiti postcards to each of your four partners.

From the swap description: 

_Take a photo of some nice graffiti art in your town and print out 4 copies, glue it on a sturdy cardboard and mail 1 naked (no envelops) to 4 partners. In the back of your card, you may want to write something about your photo (how did you find the graffiti, about the place etc)._

Sign up for the swap by this Friday, August 26th. Users with at least a 4.8 rating are welcome.
