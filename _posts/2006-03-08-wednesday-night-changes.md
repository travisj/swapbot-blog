Changes made tonight:

  * SB now sends a reminder email one week in advance to the close of the swap signup
  * Added a &#8220;Drop from swap&#8221; link at the top of the swap details page if you are signed up for the swap
  * Fixed a &#8220;Forgot my password&#8221; error where the text of the email was being displayed before the email was sent (ooops&#8230;)

Update: I got the &#8220;nag&#8221; email reminders setup. For the first month following the end of the swap, anyone who hasn&#8217;t clicked the &#8220;I sent my items&#8221; link will receive a daily email from Swap-bot letting them know they need to send their items.
