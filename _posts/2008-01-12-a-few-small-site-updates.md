Hi swap buddies!

Just wanted to let everyone know that we have created a few new swap and forum categories. Here are the additions we made:

  * New &#8220;Ephemera&#8221; swap category
  * New &#8220;Children's Items&#8221; swap category
  * New &#8220;Tag and Trade Problems&#8221; forum sub-category under the &#8220;One-on-One Trades&#8221; main category
<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://howtooearnmoneyonline.com/" title="make money online">make money online</a>
</div>

  * New &#8220;Real Life/Off Topic&#8221; forum sub-category under the &#8220;Fun&#8221; main category

These are all in response to user suggestions. Thanks for all of your help!

Also, we are currently working on a new user swap limit and a groups feature which will hopefully both be released in some capacity on Sunday. For more info on the groups feature, check out [this forum thread](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/5870).

Happy Saturday!
