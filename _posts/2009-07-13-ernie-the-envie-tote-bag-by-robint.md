This amazing (and very large) [Ernie the Envie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/robintswaps/3714181602/) tote bag was crocheted by [RobinT](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:RobinT) &#8211; the same fabulous crafter who made the previously posted [Ernie plushie](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/06/29/another-adorable-ernie/). She made it just for fun, not for a specific swap, but what a great way to carry Swap-bot packages to and from the post office!!
