A little while ago I was interviewed by Sister Diane of [CraftyPod](http://craftypod.com/index.php). We talked all about Swap-bot and how it relates to the craft community. I am so excited because the [podcast](http://craftypod.com/?p=97) of the interview is now up on the CraftyPod website! It is only 16 minutes long and I think it turned out quite well. [Check it out!](http://craftypod.com/?p=97)

[CraftyPod](http://craftypod.com/index.php) is a great website where you can find craft related podcasts as well as daily bloggings about crafty goodness. Sister Diane is the organizer of a chapter of the [Church of Craft](http://www.churchofcraft.org/index.html) in Portland, Oregon.
