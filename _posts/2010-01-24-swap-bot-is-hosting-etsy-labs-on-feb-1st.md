I will be representing Swap-bot and showing everyone how to make Matchbox Valentines, like the ones seen above. I will be bringing all of the supplies needed to make the cute boxes to the free, in-person event at Etsy&#8217;s offices (), but you can also follow along with the event via Etsy&#8217;s online . Everyone is welcome! The in-person event goes from 4-8 pm EST and you can stop by anytime. (hint: there may be some yummy Valentine treats there, too!) I love Etsy and the Craft Nights, so I am really excited for this event. I hope to see you there! 

If you can&#8217;t make it to the Etsy offices or to the Virtual Labs, there will be a detailed tutorial published on the on Tuesday. You can also download my easy matchbox template and instructions .
