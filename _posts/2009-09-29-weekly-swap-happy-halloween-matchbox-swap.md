The swap is international and open to anyone with a 4.9 rating, or higher. It is really simple and speedy &#8211; after all, Halloween is fast approaching and I want to fit in one more spooky holiday-themed craft swap before it comes and goes. 

Each participant will create and fill one 32-count matchbox in a Halloween theme for their one partner. Halloween-themed can be anything from ghosts and goblins to fall leaves to witches and monsters&#8230; really anything that reminds you of Halloween is fair game! Like always, you can download my free matchbox template PDFs . Anyone and everyone who enjoys Halloween is invited to come sign up before October 11th!

Here is an example of a matchbox I made for a similar swap in the past:
