I know, I know, Valentine&#8217;s Day is more than a month away, but it is my favorite and I am always drawn to hearts &#8212; Like the [sweet garland](http://www.etsy.com/listing/61409117/sweet-dreamy-paper-garland?ref=v1_other_2) made by [MaraMay](http://www.etsy.com/people/MaraMay?ref=ls_profile) above. It inspired me to search for more heart-filled finds on Etsy, including more garland&#8230;. you know I am a sucker for the stuff! Enjoy:

Are you a fan of Valentine&#8217;s Day, or would you rather skip it all together?
