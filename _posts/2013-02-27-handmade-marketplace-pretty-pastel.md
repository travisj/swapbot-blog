I am always drawn to pastels. Spring is usually my favorite time for fashion and shopping, with all the pretty new dresses, mint green goodies, and floral prints. [Design Sponge recently had a round up of ice cream colored home accessories](http://www.designsponge.com/2013/02/current-obsessions-ice-cream-colors.html), and it inspired me to go find a few fun pretty pastel items on Etsy. 

(Isn't the [card above](http://www.etsy.com/listing/112526310/hey-there-unicorns-notecard?) cute?! It is from [My Zoetrope](http://www.etsy.com/shop/MyZoetrope?ref=seller_info), one of my very favorite Etsy shops. [Michelle](http://my-zoetrope.blogspot.com/) is a local Brooklyn artist and I always stock up on her cute cards when I see her at craft shows. They are so fun and cheery!)

Are you a pastel fan? Or, is it all too sweet and light?
