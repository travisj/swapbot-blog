**It is Friday! And that means it is time for some spectacular links&#8230;**

  * How to make a cute [Shrinky Dink Polka Dot Necklace](http://www.everythingetsy.com/2013/06/shrinky-polka-dot-necklace-tutorial-printable/).
  * This [Rainbow Petal Cake](http://thecakeblog.com/2013/07/diy-rainbow-petal-cake.html) is absolutely gorgeous!
  * Not exactly a craft, but sort of&#8230; I think I am going to try this [braided crown hairstyle](http://camillestyles.com/beauty-style/pretty-simple-braided-crown/) this weekend.
  * One of my favorite, go-to, crafty websites &#8212; [A Beautiful Mess](http://www.abeautifulmess.com) &#8212; just [released a new book](http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2013/08/a-beautiful-mess-photo-idea-book-is-here-.html)! Cool!
  * [Going Postal](http://colossus-of-roads.blogspot.com) is a wonderful photo blog that catalogs small post offices all over the US.
