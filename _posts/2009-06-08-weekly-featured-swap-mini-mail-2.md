For Mini Mail #2 you create five blank, mini greeting cards and corresponding envelopes for your one partner. The cards can be of any theme the sender chooses but they must be 2 x 3 inches in size. The swap is international and open to new users. You must sign up for [Mini Mail #2](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/38552) before June 18th. Hand making and swapping a useful item like greeting cards is always rewarding, and the mini size required for these cards makes them perfect candidates for your small scraps of decorative paper! Have fun!
