And I regret that I still have not introduced all of the awesome participants yet&#8230; but I will rectify that over the next few weeks with eight more intro blog posts. The Ambassadors are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities. If you are interested in representing Swap-bot in your area and sending out Swap-bot swag, stay tuned for info about our upcoming second round of Ambassador applications._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [dyp](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Dyp)!** Dyp lives lives in a place close to my heart: Kansas City, Missouri. (I grew up there!) She is a [henna artist](http://www.kchenna.com) who has been a member of Swap-bot since 2008. She loves swapping ATCs. 

**Ambassador Region:** Missouri, USA

**How dyp found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I joined a craft bag swap that went through Swap-bot in 2008. After several years I rediscovered Swap-bot to trade ATCs on.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;The ease of use. Joining swaps, sending swaps and rating users is intuitive and seemless. I have joined other groups for swapping ATCs and the rating system is deplorable, tracking swaps is non existent. Swap-bot by far is the easiest to use.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;Hand drawn ATCs&#8221; 

**Check out a few of dyp&#8217;s ATCs:**

**Fun Fact about dyp:** 

&#8220;I draw to keep my sanity. Swap-bot rewards my work by allowing me to create for others and recieve goodies in the mail, all for the cost of a stamp.&#8221;

_I hope you are enjoying getting to know your fellow swappers with these Ambassador Introductions. If you are interested in swapping hand drawn ATCs, [dyp](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Dyp) is a great swapper to contact._
