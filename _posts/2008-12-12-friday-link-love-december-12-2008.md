I was trying to find some good holiday links this week, but I was only moderately successful. Here is a mixture of holiday links and and non-holiday links:

  * HOLIDAY: One of the best gift guides I have found &#8211; [The Modish Holiday Gift Guide](http://www.modishblog.com/modish/2008/12/holiday-gift-guide-2008-part-two.html).
  * HOLIDAY: This is adorable (and free!). Orange You Lucky has posted a [wiener dog reindeer embroidery pattern](http://orangeyoulucky.blogspot.com/2008/12/i-know-im-not-only-person-that-does-bit.html).
  * SEMI-HOLIDAY: Gourmet magazine has posted photos and recipes for their [favorite cookies](http://www.gourmet.com/recipes/cookies/1940s) from each year since the magazine&#8217;s inception in 1941. 
  * NON-HOLIDAY: [Living Creatively](http://www.livingcreatively.com.au/) is an Australian community website dedicated to all things creative, like art, craft, design, urban living and fashion. The site publishes an online [magazine](http://www.livingcreatively.com.au/current_issue/issue_8/) of sorts and has a [community section](http://www.livingcreatively.com.au/community/) with forums.
