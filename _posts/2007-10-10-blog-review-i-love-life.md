Some may feel that a blog called [[i] LoveLife](http://lovelife.typepad.com/) <em style="display:none"><a href="http://www.turtlesurvival.org/?fire_down_below">Fire Down Below movies</a></em> may be a little too &#8220;Pollyanna&#8221; for their taste. That may be true, but I suggest giving the blog, written by Kal Barteski, a chance. Kal is an artist, designer, and photographer who lives in Canada. Her artwork is colorful, fun and vibrant. Her attitude is cheery, but also realistic, and her blog is both a personal journal and display vehicle for her artwork. It is truly worth reading for the images alone! Try it out. Kal&#8217;s day-to-day story may just inspire you to love life, too.
