I have been somewhat absent around Swap-bot recently. I was chosen for jury duty and the process (of mostly sitting in waiting rooms) took almost two weeks. I was happy to be a part of the judicial process, but in the end, the case settled out of court, so I basically ended up doing nothing. Boo. 

BUT, I am happy to be back with another installment of Friday Link Love:

**Crafts&#8230;**

  * I am in LOVE with these [Star Wars themed embroidery pieces](http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=386742.0) (Chewbacca seen above) by [Chelsea Bloxsom](http://loveandasandwich.deviantart.com/).
  * Make a patchwork lumbar pillow out of fabric scraps using this [tutorial on Me Sew Crazy](http://www.mesewcrazy.com/2011/06/pattern-remix-guest-ashley-from.html).
  * I like this [idea of sewing together circles of paper](http://danielleflanders.blogspot.com/2011/04/boy-basics.html) to make unique gift wrapping ribbon. 
  * [How to Decorate {For the DIYâ€™er} Series](http://www.homestoriesatoz.com/how-to-decorate-for-the-diyer-series) on Home Stories A2Z.

**Food&#8230;**

  * woah! I think I have already shared a few versions of this dessert creation, but this is the ultimate version: [Oreo-stuffed, chocolate chip cookie brownie bars](http://www.kevinandamanda.com/whatsnew/new-recipes/ultimate-chocolate-chip-cookie-n-oreo-fudge-brownie-bar.html)!
  * [Beautiful rainbow Jello cups.](http://glorioustreats.blogspot.com/2011/05/taste-rainbow-jello.html)
  * [Apple Pie Cupcakes](http://thetaleoftwokitchens.blogspot.com/2011/01/apple-pie-cupcakes.html) from The Tale of Two Kitchens.

So&#8230; I wasn&#8217;t able to gather as many cool links this week, so feel free to add more in the comments!
