For this international swap, you alter three store-bought postcards (one for each of your three partners) by putting a hat on at least one human or animal on the front of the card. The swap description describes the requirements best: _&#8220;For this swap you will have 3 partners and you will send 1 altered postcard to each partner. The cards you send must be store bought cards which you have altered by putting a hat on at least one person, animal, or object on the front of each card. You can of course add more than one hat and alter the cards in any other way you like. You may use any method you like to alter the cards such as drawing, collage, stickers, stamping, etc, but remember that the card needs to survive the post so make it strong.</p> Please send your altered cards &#8220;naked&#8221; through the post without an envelope and use a real stamp if possible (unless your partner prefers otherwise). Don&#8217;t forget to write a nice message to each of your partners on the backs of the cards.&#8221; </i> It is a fun and easy postcard swap with a twist! All swappers with over a 4.5 rating are welcome to join. The sign up deadline for the in June 30th. <div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-3071px;">
