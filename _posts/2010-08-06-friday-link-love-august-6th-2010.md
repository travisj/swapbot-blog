Today I am attending the [BlogHer10](http://www.blogher.com/node/150922/schedule) conference in NYC. I am sure to discover some cool new websites to share while mingling with the other bloggy peeps, but for now, here are some fun things I found on the internet this week&#8230;

  * If you didn&#8217;t make it into the [Despicable Me Minion Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/64668), why not [crochet](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2010/08/despicable_me_minion_crochet_p.html) or [knit your own minion](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2010/08/follow-up_knit_despicable_me_m.html) like the cuties seen above?!
  * If you are looking for an easy way to do something good for others, check out Swap-bot member [sara0811&#8217;s](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sara0811) website: [GiveTimeOrMoney.org](http://www.givetimeormoney.org/). Sara researches charity organizations and gives suggestions for every monetary or time commitment level. 
  * I must try this [recipe for Root Beer Float Cupcakes](http://confessionsofacookbookqueen.blogspot.com/2010/07/root-beer-float-cupcakes.html) over on Confessions of a Cookbook Queen. They are so adorable and I love root beer floats!
  * Need a boost of positivity in your life? Who doesn&#8217;t! Check out [Kind Over Matter&#8217;s round up of free positive printables](http://kindovermatter.blogspot.com/2010/08/nice-thing-to-do-positive-printables.html). There is some adorable and inspirational stuff!
  * Like many others, I am a huge Star Wars fan, so I loved all of the amazing details of this [Star Wars-themed party from Parties by Shindig](http://amandaparkerandfamily.blogspot.com/2010/08/star-wars-party-details.html). (I also love these meticulous [Star Wars cupcakes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/52195505@N08/4802169732/) seen on Flickr.)
  * Speaking of parties, [check out some of the cool cards Martha Stewart received from her interns for her birthday last week](http://thecraftsdept.marthastewart.com/2010/08/marthas-birthday.html).

Did you see anything on the web this week that I should add to the list?
