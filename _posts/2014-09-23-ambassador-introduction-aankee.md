They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [Aankee](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Aankee)!** Aankee lives in Munich, Germany, and has been a member of Swap-bot since the beginning of 2013. She loves snail mail, envelope making, and postcard collecting. She has done 75 swaps.

**How Aankee found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I first heard of Swap-bot many years ago in an interview you gave on Sister Diane’s [CraftyPod](http://www.craftypod.com) podcast. Back then, I was an active Postcrosser and Swap-bot sounded fun, so eventually I joined! Now, I’m an absolute Swap-bot convert, because it’s a fun and diverse place and there’s so much more to do than exchange postcards!&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;My favourite aspect of Swap-bot is the opportunity to share my crafty creations with others, try out new things, get feedback and advice from more expert artists, meet like-minded people, experience the kindness of strangers… and many more!&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;My favorite swaps are postcard, letter, and drawing swaps. I haven’t participated in millions of swaps, as I believe in quality over quantity. However, I would be excited to participate in one-to-one swaps, and send out German ephemera.&#8221;

**Interesting fact about Aankee:** &#8220;I have lived in a European, an African and an Asian capital city, by the beach in France and in a manor house in the English country side, and yet my favourite place on earth is my parent’s patio.&#8221;
