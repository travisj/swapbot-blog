  I just created an off-site Swap-bot wiki where Swap-bot users and I can work together to compile helpful info about Swap-bot. Right now the Swap-bot wiki is being hosted and run on PBwiki.com. We have plans to incorporate the wiki into the main Swap-bot site eventually, but I could not wait to get it started. I know that you all have so much helpful info to share!! I think many of you know more about Swap-bot than I do! <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  So, what is a wiki? A wiki is a page or collection of pages on the internet designed to enable anyone who accesses it to contribute or modify content. The Swap-bot wiki is a knowledge and info center which is intended to supplement the Frequently Asked Questions and About pages. It will be a place where new and old users alike can go for current site and crafty info. Right now the wiki contains the following info ares: Frequently Asked Questions, Rules and Policies, Craft and Swap Term Glossary, and Press Room. I have only added a very small amount of info so far and we may have to reorganize it as we go, but it is a start!

<p>
  Do you want to get involved and add info to the Swap-bot wiki? Just comment here or send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com and I will email you an invitation to become a writer on the Swap-bot wiki. Writers can edit and add content to the wiki, and/or you can get email updates when the wiki is updated by others. I will be checking in on the wiki as often as possible and editing content, so don&#8217;t worry about messing any thing up.
