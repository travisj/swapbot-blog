Last month, Swap-bot users [TerryF](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TerryF) and [Gooseberry](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:gooseberry) met up in Savannah, Georgia. TerryF submitted this report:

She is holding a brightly decorated and sparkly sign that says “Glitter&#8221;.</p> 

The last passenger to deplane is a short woman with short hair and a big smile. She too carries a “Glitter” sign as she walks up the ramp and into the public concourse area.

The women exchange their signs and then a big hug of welcome. Gooseberry and TerryF are finally meeting up after months of exchanging swaps, pms, emails and phone calls!

They spend two full days together, experiencing beautiful, historic Savannah and environs. J. (Gooseberry&#8217;s husband) is a military man and a history buff, the perfect tour guide. So even though there is an historic plaque on almost every street corner, there is no need to stop and read them. J. knows all about Savannah’s history and can answer TerryF’s many questions.

Apart from cementing their friendship, the highlight of their time together is climbing the 178 steps to the top of the historic Tybee Island Lighthouse on the Savannah River. Whew! lol

TerryF finds that Gooseberry is very much the same person she is on Swap-bot: kind, warm, glittery and full of joy! As for Gooseberry she says TerryF is absolutely lovely and fun. She is a very dear soul and a very dear friend to Gooseberry and Gooseberry&#8217;s sweet husband as well.

They are planning another visit next winter, when they hope to also get in some crafting time. As well, they are considering inviting some other Swap-bot members in the area to join their next meet-up.</i>
