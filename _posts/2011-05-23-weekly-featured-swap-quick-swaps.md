Swap-bot member, [Lexidh](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Lexidh), hosts lots and lots of of her signature QUICK swaps. They are fast and usually easy to compile swaps. 

She just recently created a bunch more, all with a **May 27th sign up deadline**. The swaps are for experienced swappers with a 4.97 or higher rating, and the turn around time is only three days.

If you want to send and receive something FAST, sign up for one of these QUICK swaps:

  * [QUICK 5 postcard swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/91801)
  * [QUICK Ribbon swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/91806)
  * [QUICK ATC swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/91808)
  * [QUICK 50 sticker swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/91799)
  * [QUICK paper craft swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/91803)
and my favorite:

  * [QUICK 5 Somethings](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/91811)

If you love these QUICK style swaps, request to join Lexidh&#8217;s [QUICK swaps info group](http://www.swap-bot.com/group/86107759f157c8294b4a0b6f54bf9098/about). There she will announce the new QUICK swaps (which are public) and provide other relevant info.
