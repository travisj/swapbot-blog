Hello and welcome to the weekend! Your links are a little late this week, but they are just as fun&#8230; Enjoy!

  * This looks like a really nice quilt blog: [Diary of a Quilter.](http://www.diaryofaquilter.com)
  * These [Patriotic Popsicles](http://www.ohmy-creative.com/holiday-crafts/patriotic-holidays/red-white-blue-patriotic-pops/) look really fun, healthy, and fairly easy to make for the 4th of July. Or, you could do other shapes and fruits for other summer party themes!
  * Yum! I&#8217;d love some of this Sparkling Cherry Limeade right now.</li> 
    
      * This is amazing. [A succulent wall garden made entirely of FELT!](https://www.etsy.com/listing/159341649/how-does-your-garden-grow-made-to-order)
      * Another idea for your summer parties: this [Jumbo Popsicle Garland](http://ohhappyday.com/2014/06/jumbo-popsicle-garland/#more-25839) is silly and festive.
      * This [washi tape bicycle](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/20618110769108274/) is so cool!
      * Mmmmmm. More desserts&#8230; [Cocoa Chocolate Cheesecake Bars.](http://roxanashomebaking.com/cocoa-chocolate-cheesecake-bars-recipe/)
      * [How to make paper gift bags from any type of paper.](http://eclecticallyvintage.com/2012/11/diy-gift-bags-from-any-paper/)
      * And your two S&#8217;mores for this week: [Caramel Popcorn S&#8217;mores Rice Krispie Squares](http://realfoodbydad.com/caramel-popcorn-smores-krispie-squares/) and [Smoked S&#8217;mores in a Jar](http://ohjoy.blogs.com/my_weblog/2014/06/smoked-smores-in-a-jar.html).</ul> 
    
    I hope you all have a fun weekend. We are still hard at work at Swap-bot HQ, but I plan to go out in the sunshine soon! xoxo
