This French [La Poste](http://www.laposte.fr) mailbox was spotted in Paris very near to the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower also has its own small post office where you can buy stamps and postcards&#8230; but it was closed when I visited.

I did stop by a local La Poste branch near my hotel and picked up some stamps for mailing lots more postcards. Paris was the final stop on our big Europe trip, so I made sure to send plenty of snail mail from there!

Can you spot _Mona Lisa_ going into the mailbox? I got to see the painting in person at the Louvre &#8212; amazing, but so crowded! &#8212; and then sent out quite a few postcards versions of Leonardo da Vinci&#8217;s masterpiece. I love art postcards!
