And I regret that I still have not introduced all of the awesome participants yet&#8230; but I will rectify that over the next few weeks with seven more intro blog posts. The Ambassadors are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities. If you are interested in representing Swap-bot in your area and sending out Swap-bot swag, stay tuned for info about our upcoming second round of Ambassador applications._

She is a grandma of four, great-grandma of two, and has been married to her husband for over 50 years! Wow. She loves antiquing, upcycling, and collage. 

**Ambassador Region:** Central Texas, USA

**How grandmaroro found Swap-bot:** &#8221; I found Swap-bot through swapping with Lisa Vollrath on [Gluebots](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/gluebots/info).&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;Because of the wonderful people on this site, and their feedback has encouraged me to try new and more challenging swaps.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;Journals and Christmas.&#8221; 

**Check out one of grandmaroro&#8217;s traveling journal swaps:**

**Fun Fact about grandmaroro:** 

&#8220;This photo is of my &#8220;Whatzit Garden&#8221; inspired by one I saw in Temple, Texas. The idea is to add only found items from our property, donated items from my children, and marked-down items from Goodwill or garage sales, preferably items not costing more than $2.00 for any one item.&#8221;
