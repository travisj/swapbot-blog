[IndieBizChicks.com](http://indiebizchicks.com/wp/) is a website that provides business, marketing, and publicity information to “women who’d rather work for themselves, than work for the man.” The site was launched in the summer of 2007 by Crissy Herron, a writer, teacher, and speaker with a big passion for entrepreneurship and the DIY movement. She wants to provide helpful information and assistance to people in their 20s and 30s who are looking to become self-employed. If you have a small online business, like an Etsy store or a blog, that you would like to promote, IndiBizChicks.com is a great place to learn about online marketing and business development.

She is very knowledgeable when it comes to just about anything related to running an independent business online and she is a professional and informative speaker. I was impressed!

The Indie Biz Chicks site is a helpful, daily blog and much more! Crissy also creates instructive products, like eBooks and Podcasts, and hosts live e-classes. Some of her products are free and some are available for purchase. For example, Crissy is offering an upcoming, live [Holiday Marketing Tips e-class](http://www.indiebizchicks.com/holiday-marketing-tips.html) for just $3. I am also very interested in the collection of [Summer Biz Sessions](http://www.indiebizchicks.com/summer-biz-sessions.html) podcasts. For $15 you get the podcast recordings of interviews with some amazing small business owners, like [Ali Edwards](http://www.aliedwards.com/) and Jennifer of [Naughty Secretary Club](http://naughtysecretaryclub.blogspot.com/). 

Even if you aren&#8217;t interested in running your own online business, Indie Biz Chicks is a great place to learn more about online social media and female-owned businesses. Definitely sign up for the free Indie Biz Chicks Newsletter. (Simply enter you email address in the Newsletter form in the upper right hand corner of the site.) Crissy sends out newsletter emails once a week with great biz tips. Today the email contained tips on how to pick the right domain name. Very helpful info if you are just starting out!
