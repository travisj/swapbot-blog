They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [moonlightlaura](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:moonlightlaura)!** Moonlightlaura has been a member of Swap-bot since the beginning of 2013. She has done nearly one hundred swaps and makes really awesome crafts inspired by our cute logo mascot, Ernie the Envie. ([Check out her Franken-Ernie made for a Halloween swap last year.](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2013/10/29/ernie-is-ready-for-halloween/))

**Info about moonlightlaura&#8217;s region:** &#8220;I describe Louisiana as a hot and humid place to live, with a lot of diversity. Some people have a southern accent, but others don&#8217;t, like myself. We have swamps, marshes, and bayous. I live by Bayou Teche. 

When it rains bad it becomes flooded around the areas closest to it. Thankfully we are not close enough to get flooded! We also have hurricane season between June 1 and November 30. Every few years we will get hit, but our area hasn&#8217;t been hit since 2008 when Gustav and Ike hit us within a week apart in September. In the winter it can get cold, last winter (2012) we didn&#8217;t have much of a winter, but this year (2013) we had freezing temps almost every day. We also had several road closures due to ice being on the bridges and roads. 

The food here is great, although I don&#8217;t eat most of it. Even though I was born and raised in Louisiana, I was never raised on a lot of the food everyone here loves so much. I do love beignets though! I would have to say that is one of my favorite foods from here. 

The rest of the south is pretty much the same weather wise to Louisiana, and the southern region is not very mountainous. It is mostly flat land, and most of the southern states has the Gulf of Mexico as a body of water for their shores.&#8221;

**How she found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I think I came upon Swap-Bot by clicking on a banner on [postcrossing.com](http://www.postcrossing.com). I love sending and receiving postcards on there. My postcard collection has grown since joining.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I enjoy Swap-bot because I have been able to swap with many people who are very talented with their crafting, and also I was able to get many things I could not get where I live. It is fun to join swaps and receive great packages.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;My favorite types of swaps are the sticker swaps, the kawaii swaps, the moving along excess swaps and the Ernie the Envie swaps.&#8221; 

**Check out one of moonlightlaura&#8217;s Ernie-inspired swaps:**

&#8220;Made for the Ernie the Envie Holiday Happiness swap, it is a box painted in winter colors (blue and white) with a plastic canvas Ernie on top of the box. It also has snowflake stickers on the sides and glow in the dark glitter mixed with blue glitter paint so the box will glow.&#8221;

**Interesting fact about moonlightlaura:** &#8220;I am also an avid photographer. I love taking pics of things, especially of my cats and of the aircrafts we paint at work.&#8221;
