Did you know? **Nearly 24,000 children will be sleeping in New York municipal shelters tonight.**

It is that time of year again when we can help brighten the holiday season for some of NYC&#8217;s homeless youth. Help us by donating to our **5th Annual Holiday Gift Donation Drive** to benefit the [Partnership for the Homeless](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org)!

The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services, support, and advocacy for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate our donation of new, unwrapped gifts and gift cards to be handed out to children at their **[Children&#8217;s Holiday Party](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/childrens-holiday-party) in Brooklyn on December 6th, 2014**.

**Message from The Partnership for the Homeless:** _</p> 

> We thank you for your past support and look forward to your continued sponsorship as we put on our annual Holiday Party for these children and their families. The afternoon will be magical for these children with music, games, crafts, face painters, tasty food and a picture with Santa. We hope that this will result in an abundance of laughter. The need for funding remains &#8212; we need to defray the costs for items like food, entertainment and transportation for the children and their families. 
> 
> We hope to send each child home with toys, games, clothes and books, but more importantly, a smile from ear to ear. These “gifts from Santa” are only possible through donations, toy drives and the generous spirit of contributors like you. As a non-profit, we need people like you to help us make this a special afternoon.
> 
> I hope we can count on your participation once again during these tough times. Thank you for your support and wishing you a happy holiday season filled with warmth, health and happiness.

**Let’s put together a huge donation of gifts for The Partnership!!** 

We can accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $10 or $20 amounts to stores like Target, Barnes and Noble, H&M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Best Buy. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC. **Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless** because they are versatile and good for older kids, but we can also accept new, unwrapped toys, books, and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations. [Read more info about what can be donated here.](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/sponsorship-opportunities/)

Send your donations by Monday, November 24th to:

**Rachel Johnson
  
Swap-bot.com
  
285 5th Ave PMB 415
  
Brooklyn, NY 11215**

And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: **Each Swap-bot member who sends in a donation of a gift card or item will earn the removal of one low (1 or 3) rating from their account!!** You must mail your donation to Swap-bot headquarters (address above) by **Monday, November 24th**. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will receive a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only earn one rating removal credit during this donation drive –- although you are welcome to donate more than one item! 

**The Fine Print:** _All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings &#8212; it is not a &#8220;free pass&#8221; for flaking. Everyone who donates will receive an email from me with the details of the rating removal credit. You can reply to that message any time to “cash in” your credit. I also make a permanent admin note (only visible to admin) on each donor’s account stating that they have a rating removal credit._

**International option:** If you are unable to purchase appropriate gift cards in your area or ship other gifts, I am willing to accept cash donations via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com). I will then buy a gift card in your name to donate OR donate the money directly to the Partnership for the Homeless, depending on their greater need. Use the button below to donate OR send Paypal donations to rachel -at- swap-bot.com. (Replace the -at- and spaces with @.) All Paypal donations of $10 or more will count toward a rating removal.

**Use this button to donate via Paypal:**
  
The 2014 Donation Drive is now completed.

As always, [let me know if you have any questions.](http://www.swap-bot.com/contact.php)
