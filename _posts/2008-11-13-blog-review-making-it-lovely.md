Envy is not a virtue, but I cannot help being envious of the amazing talent and style of Nicole Balch of [Making it Lovely](http://makingitlovely.com/). Her blog is loosely based around the process of decorating and improving her adorable 1920s Chicago home, but she also posts about projects related to her online store, [Pink Loves Brown](http://www.pinklovesbrown.com/), and random inspirations from everyday life. In addition to the wonderful content, the site design is impeccable with the sweetest details &#8211; you&#8217;ll have fun exploring! (Nicole also has a web design company, <a href=http://www.smartandlovely.com/index.php">Smart & Lovely</a> <u style="display:none">[Wolf film](http://www.turtlesurvival.org/?wolf)</u> .) I promise, you will be in awe of her beautiful site and lovely style. 

&#8230;I sound like I have been paid to write this post, but I haven&#8217;t! Making it Lovely has just been one of my favorite blogs since it was started and I wanted to share the loveliness! Have fun!
