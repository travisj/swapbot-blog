You may have noticed that the Swap-bot blog was pretty quiet for the last week&#8230; well, all of your faithful Swap-bot admin members ([me](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson) & [travisj](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj)) were on vacation. We had a great time visiting Disney World with our family, but now we are back home and back on the job!

In honor of our fun trip, I&#8217;ve chosen the [Summer Vacation Postcard swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/68330) as this week&#8217;s featured swap. It is an fun, international postcard swap hosted by [angkb](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:angkb). Simply pick up two extra postcards while you are on your summer vacation (I picked up some extra Minnie & Mickey postcards for my partners), and send one to each of your two partners once parters are assigned. 

The sign up for the [Summer Vacation Postcard swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/68330) is open until August 20th, so you still have plenty of time to get home from your summer travels before it starts. I can&#8217;t wait to see where everyone visited this summer!
