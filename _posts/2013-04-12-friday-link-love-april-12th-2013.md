Hello and happy Friday! There was a lot going on this week&#8230; including an internet outage here at Swap-bot HQ&#8230; but I still found a bunch of great links that I just had to share. Have fun!

  * Garland is just about the hotest thing going in the craft world these days&#8230; but this adorable [DIY donut garland](http://icingdesignsonline.blogspot.com/2013/04/a-diy-donut-garland.html) from Icing Designs (seen above) is a fun and fresh take. I love it!
  * These [Wood and Neon Lanyard Necklaces](http://www.marthastewart.com/904571/wood-and-neon-lanyard-necklaces) from Martha Stewart look like a cool craft project.
  * In time for Earth Day on the 22nd, [Sixteen Recycling Crafts for Kids](http://www.favecrafts.com/Earth-Day-Crafts/16-Recycle-Crafts-for-Kids/ml/1). (And grown ups, too!) 
  * Yes! [Airmail washi tape!](http://www.cutetape.com/shop/stamp-airmail-washi-tape.html)
  * These [mini balloon placecards](http://ohhappyday.com/2013/04/mini-balloon-placecards/) on Oh Happy Day would be so cute at a birthday party.
  * Yum! I want to make these [Brown Butter Salted Caramel Snickerdoodles](http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/brown-butter-salted-caramel-snickerdoodles/).
  * Read [this great piece](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/04/handwritten_notes_are_a_rare_c.html) on the Harvard Business Review blog about the importance of handwritten notes.
  * Check out this fancy stationery subscription servie, [Nicely Noted](http://www.nicelynoted.com/).
  * I don't know how I feel about this new service: [Outbox.](https://www.outboxmail.com/) They receive all of your snail mail for you, scan it, and send you digital copies. Interesting.
  * In the NYC area?? Plan to attend the [Spring Handmade Cavalcade](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/index.html) on May 4th. Swap-bot is a [sponsor](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/sponsors.html)!
  * I think this counts as your S'more of the week: [Six-Layer Chocolate Cake with Toasted Marshmallow Filling](http://www.browneyedbaker.com/2013/03/25/six-layer-chocolate-cake-with-toasted-marshmallow-filling-malted-chocolate-frosting/).

Happy, happy weekend!
