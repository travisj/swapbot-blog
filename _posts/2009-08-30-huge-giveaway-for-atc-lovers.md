We have been going through a dry spell in regard to giveaways here on the Swap-bot blog, but we are back with a bang! I have an amazing set of ATC-related goodies to send to one lucky winner. The set includes the , which comes with 20 blank ATC cards that are pre-punched to hang on the carousel, plus (to use with your existing ATCs to hang them on the carousel), (for organizing your ATCs on the carousel), and the special (which creates the perfect little notches used to hang cards on the carousel).

It is a really nice set of ATC tools &#8211; over $50 in value! I have been intrigued by the 7 gypsies carousel ever since I saw it online, but I recently saw one in action at a craft store and I was impressed. It is made of heavy metal and the cards actually attach to it pretty securely, but they are also easily removed and switched around. If you are not into ATCs, the carousel can be used as a mini, vertical scrapbook of sorts. You can put photos in the sleeves and decorate the cards with journaling or more photos. 

Because this giveaway is slightly larger than usual, there are two ways to enter:

  1. Post a comment here on the blog telling us about your favorite ATC you have made or received, and/or&#8230; 
      * Post about Swap-bot (it can be about this giveaway, or about Swap-bot in general) somewhere on the web (your blog, twitter, a public forum) and link to your post in your comment. </ol> 
        Make sure to include your Swap-bot username and email address in your comment or your entry will not be counted. Each person can enter this giveaway drawing up to two times by making both types of comments. Please make a separate comment for each entry. The deadline for entering this giveaway is Friday, September 18th. The winner will be randomly drawn and announced on Sunday, September 20th. If you have trouble commenting on the blog, you can send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. Good luck!
        
        **UPDATE:** A few of your comments got caught in our spam filter, but I think I have approved them all as of today (9/10/09) and they should be showing up below. I will continue to check through the spam comments to see if it mislabeled any legitimate comments. I don&#8217;t want anyone to miss out on this giveaway!
