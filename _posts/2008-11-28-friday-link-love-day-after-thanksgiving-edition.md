I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving and didn&#8217;t eat too much turkey. Are you all hitting the shops today for the sales? If you&#8217;re staying home like me, here are some fun links to keep you occupied:

  * If you live in a cold climate, check out this [ice wreath tutorial from Resurrection Fern](http://resurrectionfern.typepad.com/resurrection_fern/2008/11/how-to-make-ice-wreaths-.html). The ice wreaths are so beautiful and they do not seem very difficult to make.
  * Design Sponge has a great [gift wrapping round-up](http://www.designspongeonline.com/2008/11/paper-holiday-gift-wrapping.html) of creative ideas for wrapping holiday packages.
  * ¿Usted habla español? Then you must take a look at the [We Love Crafts online magazine](http://welovecraftsmag.com./). The two current issues of the magazine are mostly written in Spanish, but they contain lots of great images and inspiration that non-spanish speakers will also enjoy.
  * This is a little pricey, but it is a very cute idea: [paper gingerbread house kit from Paper Source](http://www.paper-source.com/cgi-bin/paper/item/Gingerpaper-House-Kit/300.439/4071295442.html).
  * Do you love buying handmade? Would you like to learn more about independent European artists and designers? You should check out [The Ultimate Handmade European Sampler Box&#8230; Get Eurofied!](http://www.geteurofied.com/index.html) From the Get Eurofied site: &#8220;Get Eurofied is a box filled with samples from independent crafters. It gives you the opportunity to see, try and use some great items handcrafted from the heart of Europe!&#8221; (Get Eurofied! is also sponsoring our [current giveaway](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/11/24/sponsored-giveaway-get-eurofied/). Sign up now &#8212; the contest closes on Sunday!)
