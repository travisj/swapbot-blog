They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**An interesting fact about queenelisheba:** 

&#8220;Back in 2005 I incurred an injury, a herniated disc in my back and that accident, accidentally made me a yoga teacher. Which led me to Reiki, and that led to more healing modalities. In essence that injury turned me into a healer. I am grateful for that injury, that occurrence, every day of my life. It changed me for the better. I love my life.&#8221;
