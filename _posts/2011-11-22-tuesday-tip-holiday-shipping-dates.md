The USPS has released their [Holiday Shipping Info](https://www.usps.com/holiday/welcome.htm). Here are some of the important recommended **First Class Mail** shipping dates if you want to get items to your recipient by December 25:

**Domestic Mail &#8211; Ship by December 20th
  
International Mail, Africa & South America &#8211; Ship by December 2nd
  
International Mail, everywhere else &#8211; Ship by December 9th
  
** 

Also:

The postal services work hard over the holidays to deliver a huge quantity of gifts and greeting cards, but keep in mind that items may be delayed. If possible, work in a few extra mail transit days into your swap planning. If you are creating a new swap, keep in mind that most post offices will be closed on December 25 and January 1st, so plan your mail deadlines accordingly. 

**_There is still time to get in some fun holiday swapping, but don't wait too long!!_**
