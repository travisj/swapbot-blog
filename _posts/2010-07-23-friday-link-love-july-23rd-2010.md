Some more of the best of the crafty internet just for you&#8230;

  * Diane Gilleland, of [CraftyPod](http://www.craftypod.com/), has an informative article, [Cheap and Simple Tools for Better Blog Photography](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2010/07/cheap_and_simple_tools_for_bet.html), on Craftzine.com that can help improve your photography with just a few small tweaks to your process.
  * This totally and completely grosses me out, but it is pretty ingenious: [How to make spider silk thread](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-Spider-Silk-Thread/) &#8211; out of real spider webs!
  * If you are thinking about selling your handmade wares online, but don&#8217;t know which digital marketplace to choose, check out this [helpful comparison article on CraftCritique.com](http://www.craftcritique.com/2010/07/buying-and-selling-handmade-crafts.html). (Also check out my recent [review of crafting apps for the iPhone](http://www.craftcritique.com/2010/07/craft-apps-for-iphone.html)!) 
  * I have told you about [Craft Hope](http://crafthope.com/) before &#8211; a site dedicated to making a difference in the world through craft &#8211; and now there is a [Craft Hope book](http://crafthope.com/craft-hope-book/). It contains 32 projects that can be created and donated to specific charities. Lovely!
  * I love this recipe on Cooking with My Kid because I love Greek salads and anything miniature: [Bite Sized Greek Salads](http://cookingwithmykid.com/recipes/bite-sized-greek-salad/). Yum!
  * [Upon a Fold](http://uponafold.com.au/) &#8211; an online Australian stationery shop that I just discovered and fell in love with.
  * On Dollar Store Crafts: [make cupcake garden lights](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2010/07/make-cupcake-garden-lights/) &#8211; cute!
  * If you are interested in home decor, [Be@Home](http://pocketchange.become.com/category/home-and-garden) is a great resource full of home and garden ideas.
  * And, just for fun: [CUPCAKE CAR!!](http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/sitelets/christmasbook/fantasy.jhtml?cid=CBF10_O4428&icid=NMCDpage48&r=cat24050744&rdesc=The%20Christmas%20Book&rparams=xpage%3D48)
