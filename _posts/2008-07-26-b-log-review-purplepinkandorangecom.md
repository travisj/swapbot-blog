PurplePinkandOrange was one of the first sites to organize public swaps through Swap-bot over three years ago. Amy was a great supporter of Swap-bot and we have missed her fun monthly swaps&#8230; but guess what! A new PurplePinkandOrange swap is going on right now! Sign up for the [Friends of purplepinkandorange.com postcard swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/18782)! The swap is international and everyone is welcome. Each participant will send postcards to three partners by the end of August. The sign up deadline is August 15th. Have fun!
