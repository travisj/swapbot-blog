**Happy, happy weekend to everyone!** 

Travis and I have a big Swap-bot working weekend ahead of us. Don&#8217;t forget: [the site may be inaccessible tomorrow afternoon and evening.](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2014/06/04/scheduled-site-maintenance-on-saturday-afternoon/) We will try to work as fast as possible to minimize the down time. 

**For now, enjoy these fun links&#8230;**

  * Did you know that today is [National Doughnut Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Doughnut_Day)?! Here are just a few fun links to get you in the donut celebrating mood:
  * First, let&#8217;s try to be a little healthy&#8230; two baked donut recipes: [Baked Cinnamon Donuts with Vanilla Glaze](http://diethood.com/2011/08/01/baked-cinnamon-doughnuts-with-vanilla-glaze/) and [Baked Chocolate-Peanut Butter Donuts with Vanilla-Peanut Butter Glaze](http://www.averiecooks.com/2011/11/baked-chocolate-peanut-butter-donuts-with-vanilla-peanut-butter-glaze.html).
