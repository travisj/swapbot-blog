It warms my heart to see swaps on Swap-bot that are inspired BY Swap-bot! Last month, [FunnerKimberley](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:FunnerKimberley) hosted the [Ernie the Envie Inspired Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/154162). For the swap, participants simply had to make a craft that featured Ernie, the Swap-bot envelope mascot.

**Check out these amazing creations made for the swap:**

[Dmarie](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:dmarie) made this adorable Ernie zippered pouch. Such great craftsmanship! I love that it is lined in orange.

[FunnerKimberley](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:FunnerKimberley) received this incredible GLASS Ernie from [smadronia](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:smadronia). Wow! That is the first glass Ernie I have ever seen!

This lovely needlepoint Ernie was crafted by [moonlightlaura](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:moonlightlaura) to be used as a notebook cover. Very nice!

**So many fantastic Ernie creations!** 

But I want more! Please send me photos of your Swap-bot-inspired craft to rachel -at- swap-bot.com. I&#8217;d love to see each and every one of them!
