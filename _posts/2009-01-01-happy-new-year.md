What a busy time of year! Or, maybe a busy beginning of a new year&#8230; 2009, wow! Anyhoo, Travis and I were traveling over the holidays visiting our families and eating lots of yummy treats. We had planned on working on Swap-bot more consistently over the trip, but not all plans work out. We got back late Wednesday night and have been trying to get things back in order since then. Today I am really getting down to business answering lots of emails (and doing all of our travel laundry). If you wrote, please be patient. I promise to try to fix any problems. Don&#8217;t panic. I have a feeling 2009 is going to be a great year! xoxo
