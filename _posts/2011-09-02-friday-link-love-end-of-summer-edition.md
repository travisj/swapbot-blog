It is the official end of summer weekend&#8230; and I&#8217;m already thinking snow?!

  * It isn&#8217;t winter yet, but I am keeping this beautiful [snowball and snowflake wreath idea](http://twojunkchix.blogspot.com/2011/01/snowball-wreath.html) (seen above) in mind for the chillier season.
  * The Richmond Art Gallery in Canada is having its first ever [International Mail Art Exhibition & Swap](http://www.richmondartgallery.org/mail-art-2011.php) and you are invited to contribute artwork. The deadline is October 1st.
  * Eek! Martha Stewart&#8217;s [Halloween issue](http://thecraftsdept.marthastewart.com/2011/08/halloween-special-issue.html) is freaky looking!
  * [Maker Faire](http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2011/) is coming back to New York! [Find out how you can volunteer at the event.](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2011/09/volunteer_for_maker_faire_new.html)
  * WipUp.net creator, Kathreen Ricketson, has a [new quilting book](http://whipup.net/2011/09/01/introducing-my-new-quilting-book-little-bits-quilting-bee/) out and it looks cute!
  * [Sixteen free printable party invitations.](http://blogs.babble.com/family-style/2011/08/28/16-free-printable-party-invitations/)
  * Your S&#8217;more of the week: [Ultimate S&#8217;more Cake](http://fatgirltrappedinaskinnybody.blogspot.com/2011/06/ultimate-smore-anniversary-cake.html).
  * Want something sweet, easy, and not too unhealthy? Try my friend, Jessica&#8217;s, [Nutella Smoothie](http://www.acedepartment.com/blog/2011/09/02/food-friday-nutella-smoothie/). 
  * These [Strawberry Cake Kebabs](http://nauticalwheeler.tumblr.com/post/9628264967/strawberry-dessert) would make a fun and easy party food.
  * And, one more crazily delicious-looking dessert recipe: [Peanut Butter Cup Brownies](http://www.bakedperfection.com/2009/07/peanut-butter-cup-brownies.html).

Have a great weekend!
