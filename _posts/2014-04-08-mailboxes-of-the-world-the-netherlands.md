Swap-bot Headquarters in on the road! Since I will be traveling through Europe for the next month, I thought it would be fun to share photos of the mailboxes I find in each country. **These mailboxes are part of [PostNL](http://www.postnl.post/) and I spotted them in Amsterdam.** 

_Internet is not as available or reliable as I was hoping so far on our journey&#8230; but hopefully I&#8217;ll be sharing more mailboxes soon!_
