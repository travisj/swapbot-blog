This week&#8217;s featured swap is [New Year&#8217;s Resolution Inchies](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/26016) hosted by [cmcedwards](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cmcedwards). Inchies are tiny (1 inch by 1 inch) artworks. They are a little like artist trading cards and they can be made out of fabric or paper. You can create your inchies using collage, painting, drawing, or any other medium or technique you enjoy! For more info about making inchies you could read this [website](http://www.sewfunpatterns.com/inchies.html) , check out [Inchie Arts, LLC](http://www.inchiearts.com/) , or view all of the lovely images from the [inchies Flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/inchies/).

The [New Year&#8217;s Resolution Inchies swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/26016) calls for some creative art making: &#8220;Each person will have two partners. For each of those partners you will create four inchies. These inchies will express your resolutions and wishes for 2009. You may choose to write the resolution in words, use a picture, draw, create a symbol or any other way to express your resolutions in the 1&#8243; x 1&#8243; space.&#8221;

The sign up deadline for this international swap is December 14th, and you must have your inchies sent by December 20th. New users are welcome with a filled out profile. If you are interested in this creative swap, start thinking about and planning your inchies now so that you can complete them within the quick turn-around time!
