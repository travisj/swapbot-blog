This week&#8217;s featured swap is the <a href=http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2327">Fabric Art Charms Swap</a> coordinated by [funkychickenoriginals](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2991). Yes, funkychickenoriginals was also the coordinator of last week&#8217;s featured swap. I did not mean to pick the same host twice, but this swap just looked so original I couldn&#8217;t pass it up. In the future, I will be sure to spread the coordinator love around a bit more&#8230;

Anyhoo, the Fabric Art Charms Swap is all about swapping a fun new art item: fabric charms. Each swap participant has only one partner to send to, but they must send twelve fabric charms. It is an international swap, but please read all of the [swap details](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2327) before signing up. The swap is open for signup through April 1st.

So, what exactly is a fabric art charm? Fabric art charms are 1&#8243; squares of fabric and fibers that are stitched around all of the edges. They can include beads, buttons, or other embellishments, and they often include a grommet so that the charms can be attached to jewelry. They can also be called fabric collage charms or fiber art charms.
