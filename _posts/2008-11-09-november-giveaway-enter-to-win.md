This month I have a very cool tool to send to one lucky winner. It is a [Xyron](http://www.xyron.com/) sticker maker! Specifically the [Xyron 250 2.5” create-a-sticker™](http://www.xyron.com/enUS/Products/2_5__create-a-sticker_.html) . I use my Xyron to create stickers out of all sorts of things, like photos, ribbons, confetti, etc. You simply run any item through the Xyron and it makes the back sticky! Very cool. The Xyron I have for the giveaway comes filled with 20 feet of permanent adhesive. That will last a very long time, but you can purchase refills at most craft stores. (btw, the Xyron company is in no way sponsoring this giveaway, I just really like the product and wanted to give one away&#8230; of course, I wouldn&#8217;t turn down a sponsored giveaway if any company is interested. hint, hint.)

To enter the drawing for this giveaway simply comment on this blog post with your answer to the following question:

**What is your favorite thing to swap and why?** 

Each person can only enter once. You must have a Swap-bot account in good standing (not suspended) with a valid mailing address to enter.
