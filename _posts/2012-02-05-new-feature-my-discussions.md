Travis and I are working on a few small site tweaks today, one of which is the new forum feature: **My Discussions.**

You&#8217;ll find the &#8220;My Discussions&#8221; link in the Forums drop down menu at the top of the page. The My Discussions page will list all of the forum threads that you have ever started in order of most recent activity. Both your group and public forum threads will be listed. (If you are no longer in a group in which you previously created a forum thread, you will still see the thread listed on your My Discussions page, but won&#8217;t be able to click through to read it.)

I know that there are many things that need to change on Swap-bot that may be higher priorities, and we are working hard on them, but this was one feature that we could easily implement at this time. I thought it would be very helpful (for me and hopefully others) to find our past threads and see what activity we may have missed. (The feature is not perfect and there are some issues with users who have changed their usernames, but it is a start.)

Let me know if you notice any glitches&#8230;
