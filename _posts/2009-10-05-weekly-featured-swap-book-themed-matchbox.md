The swap is a bit detailed, so I will quote the requirements directly from the excellent swap description: 

_&#8220;In this swap you will create 1 matchbox for 1 partner based on one of their favorite books. Use the 32-count size_ [free template ] _and make the outside of the matchbox look like the book &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have to look like the actual cover (unless you are really creative, that would be awesome!) but it does have to look like a book. It must have the title of the book you choose. Fill the inside with items that relate to the book. For instance (I&#8217;m just using this as an example because it&#8217;s so well known) for_ Twilight _you could put in a tiny fang, something to represent blood drops, an apple bead for the cover? Try to find at least 3-5 items that represent the book. You can make them if you wish. If you can&#8217;t fill the matchbox up with those things, add some brads and buttons and ribbon, etc in the color scheme and fill it to the brim!&#8221;_ 

To join the , you must have completed at least five previous craft swaps and have no 1 or 3 ratings. You also need to have a healthy listing of favorite books on your profile page so that your sending partner will know what type of matchbox to create. 

The swap is international and you must get signed up before October 15th. I think this swap is such a fun and unique idea! I am going to get signed up right now&#8230;
