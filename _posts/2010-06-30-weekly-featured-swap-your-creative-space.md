I don&#8217;t often feature &#8220;Type 1: Electronic&#8221; swaps as the weekly swap, but there are some great ones out there in the Swap-bot universe! So, this week I am featuring , an email swap hosted by . For the swap, you will email two photos of your own creative space (your office, craft corner, art studio, etc) with a description to each of your five partners. (Above is a photo of my office space &#8211; on a clean day &#8211; where I do all of my working and crafting.)

More instructions from the swap description:

_&#8220;Please include a brief summary of what we&#8217;ll see, features you&#8217;re proud of, why exactely you need your cat sleeping in that exact place, procrastination devices we might spy ðŸ˜‰ &#8230; and please tell us what you&#8217;re doing there &#8211; writing, crafting, woodwork, alienating significant others, developing world domination plans&#8230;&#8221;_ 

It is an easy email swap, but I always find it fascinating to see where other people create! New users are welcome in the swap, but everyone must have a completed profile and zero no-sends. The sign up date is coming up quickly on Monday, July 5th, so if you want to share your creative space with your fellow swappers!
