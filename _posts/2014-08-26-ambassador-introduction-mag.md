They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

Meet our next Ambassador, [mag](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mag)! Mag has been a member of Swap-bot since 2007 and she has completed more than 260 swaps. Wow! She loves crafting and exploring the world and other cultures through snail mail. 

**Ambassador Region:** Singapore <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo.jpg" alt="photo" width="325" height="217" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11270" />

**How mag found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I remember in 2007, before I entered university, I wanted to travel the world and experience the culture of every single country. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t have the funds to do so. So I searched for a way to get that same experience in the comfort of my home, and you wouldn&#8217;t imagine how elated I was to find a site that allowed me to achieve that wish.

Also at that time, I became more involved in the art of handmade and I used this opportunity to exchange handmade goods as well as craft supplies. This expanded not just my creative tools, but my imagination as well. It wasn&#8217;t long before I became &#8216;addicted&#8217; to swapping with all the happy mail filling my letterbox.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;Today, although I have begun fulfilling my dream of travelling the world, I continue to do cultural exchanges because I love to see the world through someone else&#8217;s eyes. Also, there are so many places but so little time, so this has allowed me to explore more within a shorter span of time. Swapping has also expanded my crafting sphere and I love the thrill of giving and receiving something special. Furthermore, it has helped me expand my social circle beyond my country as I started penpalling with those I &#8216;met&#8217; through the site. I couldn&#8217;t be more thankful for this site!&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;Cultural, handmade, and themed swaps.&#8221; 

**One of mag&#8217;s most excellent sent swaps:** &#8220;This was rather difficult for me to choose, so here&#8217;s my most recent cultural swap from Singapore to Portugal.&#8221; _(Seen below.)_

**Interesting facts about mag:** &#8220;I love pretending I&#8217;m a tourist in my own country and sussing out this place with a fresh perspective.&#8221;
