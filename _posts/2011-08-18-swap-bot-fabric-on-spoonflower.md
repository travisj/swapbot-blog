Have you heard of [Spoonflower](http://www.spoonflower.com)? It is a site that allows you to design your own fabric. 

I have been meaning to try it since I first heard about it in 2008, but kept putting it off. Well, no longer! Today is [Free Fabric Swatch Day on Spoonflower](http://blog.spoonflower.com/free-swatch-day-spoonflower.html), which means you can design your own fabric and have an 8-inch sample of it mailed to you for free! wow! 

If you want to get your free sample, your order must be placed by 12 noon EST tomorrow (August 19th). 

I quickly put together the [Ernie fabric](http://www.spoonflower.com/fabric/720315) you see above and ordered a free swatch. I can&#8217;t wait to see it in person! If it turns out ok, I can make it available for public sale. Stay tuned!
