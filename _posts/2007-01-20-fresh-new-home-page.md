Swap-bot finally has a new look! We remodeled the home page and added a rotating selection of images from [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) that all have the tag &#8220;swapbot&#8221;. Check it out! (If you still want to see the original home page, don&#8217;t worry, it is right [here](http://www.swap-bot.com/info.php).) The rest of Swap-bot is still pretty much the same&#8230; with the addition of the awesome new messaging system.

Your faithful and intrepid [Swap-bot webmaster](http://www.eightfivethree.com/) is busy working on lots of new ideas for the site. Look for updates in the swap search system and the swap image gallery in the near future.
