The group, founded by [littleZ](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:littleZ), has 192 members. All of the members of the group live in The Netherlands and much of the group description and the very active forums are in Dutch. 

Group member, [8r1id](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:8r1id) contacted me recently to let me know that the group is planning their third in-person meet-up. How cool! She says that the group is very active and the members have become good friends. 8r1id also made the amazing felt fairytale dolls seen below for the [Sprookjeskunst (fairytale art) Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/85083). I love them!

If you live in The Netherlands, you should check out the [Dutch Swappers Group](http://www.swap-bot.com/group/45323d4339863b506b93b3301d405166/about). The group has a great Flickr account and even their own blog featuring all the swap pictures:
