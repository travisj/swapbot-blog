Crafty goodness from across the world wide web:

  * [<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/10163.jpg" alt="" title="10163" width="48" height="48" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-569" />](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:msteidl)Swap-bot member, [msteidl](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:msteidl), is running a contest. If you can guess where his Swap-bot avatar image is from, he&#8217;ll send you 2 mix CD&#8217;s of his choice &#8211; free &#8211; all costs handled by him. Message him via the Swap-bot message system to send him your guess.
  * I like this Craft:zine tutorial for a sparkly [comic book starburst](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2009/02/craft_project_comic_book_starb.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954).
  * If you love embroidery, [Sublime Stitching](http://sublimestitching.com/) is lots of fun. Jenny Hart&#8217;s [&#8220;Now-I-Get-It Stitching Diagrams&#8221;](http://sublimestitching.com/stitches) are super-easy to follow and now she has a [version for lefties](http://sublimestitching.com/stitchesforlefties)!
  * Because I am constantly pulling up my low-rise jeans, I found this CraftStylish tutorial for [How to Fix a Belt Loop on Jeans](http://www.craftstylish.com/item/42095/how-to-fix-a-belt-loop-on-jeans) helpful.
  * I hear that fanny packs are coming back in style (just ask [Donna Karan](http://www.glamour.com/fashion/blogs/slaves-to-fashion/2009/02/donna-karan-in-a-fanny-pack-di.html)), but don&#8217;t call them fanny packs! [Rocknroar](http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=24253) on Crafter has a good [tutorial for making a hipslinger bag](http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=31379.0) &#8211; not a fanny pack!
  * If you live in the US state of Oregon, this Sunday is the Swap-bot Member Appreciation Event. Read more <a href=http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/02/26/member-event-in-eugene-or-this-sunday/">here</a>.

Have a great weekend, everyone!
