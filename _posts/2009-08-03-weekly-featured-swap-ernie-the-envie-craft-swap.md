This week we are featuring another Swap-bot-themed swap. This one is the [Ernie the Envie themed craft swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/41830) hosted by [MyAliceFair](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MyAliceFair) . Ernie is the Swap-bot logo/mascot and for the swap you must create crafts which include his likeness. Here is some more info from the swap description:

_&#8220;For this swap you will have 1 partner. You will send this partner 2 Ernie the Envie themed handmade crafts of your choice. It could be an Ernie themed ATC, an Ernie Stuffie, An Ernie art collage, an Ernie phone charm, An Ernie handmade anything!&#8221;_

The swap is open for sign up through the end of August and all participants must have participated in at least five prior mail swaps and have over a 4.9 overall rating. I have signed up and can&#8217;t wait to get started on my Ernie crafts!!

For ideas of what to make, check out some of the great [Ernie projects](http://blog.swap-bot.com/category/swappy-goodness/) that have already been featured here on the blog. I would love to share photos of any of the finished projects from the [Ernie the Envie themed craft swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/41830) on the blog, as well. Send me your photos to rachel [at] Swap-bot.com. Happy swapping!
