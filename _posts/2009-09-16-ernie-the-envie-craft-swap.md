I received my first email with a photo of an item made for the the other day. created this adorable Ernie stuffie and keychain:

<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ernies.jpg" alt="ernies" title="ernies" width="470" height="380" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2631" />

Both are magnificent, but I have a soft spot in my heart for the mini keychain &#8211; so cute! 

For the same swap, I made the Ernie matchbox below (he is glittery) and some personalized swap cards for my partner. (Stay tuned for a free Ernie swap card download in the near future!)
