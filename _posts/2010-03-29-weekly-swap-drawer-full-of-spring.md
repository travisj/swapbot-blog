You already know that I love altered matchboxes, but what you might not know is that I have never tried making a &#8220;matchbox chest of drawers.&#8221; That is going to change, though, because I have signed up for this week&#8217;s featured swap: hosted by . For this international swap, each participant will send a three-drawer matchbox &#8220;dresser&#8221; to their one partner. The dresser should be decorated in a spring theme and each drawer should contain items based on three specific categories:

  * Drawer 1: Spring Colours. Fill this drawer with items that are the colours of spring (yellow,lavender, pink etc.) Of course, please check your partner&#8217;s likes and dislikes for colours. If they only like blue,for example, there is lots of pale blue shades to choose from.
  * Drawer 2: Spring Words: How does spring make you feel? What does it mean to you? Share your thoughts in phrases or words with your partner. Are there special holidays that happen in your country? Let them know!
  * Drawer 3: Spring Fling This is a profile surprise you can pop into the last drawer!
