This month I have an original, pink, [We R Memory Keepers](https://weronthenet.com/index.shtml) [Crop-A-Dial](http://www.amazon.com/We-Memory-Keepers-Crop-A-Dile-Eyelet/dp/B0013LCX32) to giveaway to one lucky winner. The Crop-A-Dial is a craft tool which silently punches holes and sets eyelets and snaps. It can punch 1/8&#8243; and 3/16&#8243; holes through all types of material, including fabric, wood, and plastic. Portable and easy to use, the Crop-A-Dial is a favorite tool of serious scrapbookers and crafters.
