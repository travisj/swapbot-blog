This week&#8217;s featured swap is [ATC Inspired by Your Username](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/69608) hosted by [Arabella](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Arabella). I think it would be fascinating to &#8220;see&#8221; the story behind other swappers&#8217; usernames!

The swap instructions: &#8220;Your ATC can be a literal interpretation of your username (like CupcakeLover making an ATC featuring a cupcake surrounded by hearts, for example), or more abstract if you like. Include a note to your partner explaining the connection to your username, and tell your partner a little about how you chose the name. Be sure to include the swap and username on the back of the ATC!&#8221; 

You only send one Artist Trading Card to one international partner for this swap. [Sign up by August 16th.](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/69608)
