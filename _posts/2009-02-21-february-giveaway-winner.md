A winner has been randomly chosen in the [February Giveaway for the Doodlebug True Love Essentials Kit](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/01/31/february-giveaway-enter-to-win/). The winner is [mommy2dylan](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mommy2dylan) !! The Valentine&#8217;s Day scrapbook kit will be mailed to her on Monday.

Here is her answer to the question, **What is your favorite handmade valentine memory, given or received?** 

Mekel Carrier on 03 Feb 2009: In Elementry School I loved makeing/decorating my own Valentine’s Day Box to put on my desk for all my classmates to put their Valentine’s to me in. I couldn’t wait to get home and look at all of them! Now I love making Valentine’s Day cards to send to my girlfriends and making something special for dinner and dessert for my hubby and I. I can’t wait until my kids are old enough to get to make the Valentine’s Day boxes again! (My swap-bot name is mommy2dylan.)

Congrats, mommy2dylanl! Thank you to everyone for entering. There will be a new giveaway announced shortly. xoxo
