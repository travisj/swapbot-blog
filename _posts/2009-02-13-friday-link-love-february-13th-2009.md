Lots of love and big-hearted goodness this week:

  * Valentine&#8217;s Day is tomorrow. Make this cute [Love Bird](http://mollychicken.blogs.com/my_weblog/2009/02/4th-attempt.html) for your sweetie.
  * Also, [Whip Up has a great list of free, downloadable Valentines](http://whipup.net/2009/02/12/valentines-downloads/) for those of us who leave things until the last second.
  * [Handmade Help](http://handmadehelpsout.blogspot.com/search/label/Auction) is a site created to help those affected by the fires in Victoria, Australia. The site lists tons of big and small ways to get involved and help, like by buying handmade items with the proceeds going to charities, or donating your own handmade items that will go to the victims of the fires. You can even help by sending surplus craft supplies to crafters who lost everything in the fires &#8211; that is definitely something I can do!
  * For those of you in Washington state, [Flowering Tree Botanicals](http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=3293) is hosting a fundraising craft fair for an animal sanctuary on May 2nd near Seattle. They are still looking for vendors and if you think you might be interested email layla [at] floweringtreebotanicals.com asap for an application.
