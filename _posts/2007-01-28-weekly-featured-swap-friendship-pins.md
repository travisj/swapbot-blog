It is a unique and simple international swap that will bring you back to the 80s! Each swapper sends a set of five friendship pins to each of their two partners. Friendship pins are safety pins decorated with seed beads. Check out [this website](http://www.makingfriends.com/safety_pin_projects.htm) for design ideas. This is such a fun, easy, and inexpensive swap &#8211; don&#8217;t miss it!
