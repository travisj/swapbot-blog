This week&#8217;s featured swap, [Fill an Envelope Full of Crafty Supplies](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/35162), was chosen in honor of Earth Day. The swap, hosted by [cittylou](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cittylou) , is quite simple &#8211; fill an envelope full of crafty odds & ends for your partner &#8211; but it helps us give new life to craft supplies and doodads that might otherwise be languishing in our craft stash. Now is the time to recycle and use all of our crafty resources efficiently!! 

[The swap details](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/35162): You must fill an A5-size envelope (21cm x 15cm or 9.5 by 6 inches) with at least five different types of craft items. Items can include yarns, ribbons, buttons, embroidery thread, felt, fabrics, patterned papers, stickers, embellishments, etc&#8230; From the swap description: &#8220;The package should be of a reasonable size and filled full of craft goodies, and above all must contain a high quality selection of goodies. It would be worth reading people&#8217;s wishlists to try and give them some things they would really like.&#8221; The swap is international and does not accept new users.
