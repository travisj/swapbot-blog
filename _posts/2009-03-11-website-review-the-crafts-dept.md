[The Crafts Dept.](http://thecraftsdept.com/) is a new blog from the Martha Stewart Empire. It was just started on February 27th with intentions of being a meeting place for all of the crafters working for the many Martha Stewart media outlets, like the television show, Living magazine, and the Martha Stewart craft supplies brand. There is not much content at this point, but the contributors plan on sharing official Martha Stewart projects as well as their own personal crafty endeavors.

From the blog&#8217;s introduction: &#8220;Welcome to the Crafts Department blog. We thought a blog would be a great way to share even more about the crafts we create for Martha Stewart Living as well as what we craft on our own. We hope to provide you with a peek behind the scenes to some of our stories, our inspiration, our favorite sources, as well as some of the projects we are personally working on. Periodically crafters from our television show and from the Martha Stewart Crafts line will also post entries to let us know what is happening in their areas as well. We hope you enjoy it.&#8221;

I find some of the Martha Stewart crafters to be a little too hardcore and strict for my taste (they are always talking about how clean and organized you should keep your craft room &#8211; phooey!), but I think [The Crafts Dept.](http://thecraftsdept.com/) will be a good resource with great photo galleries at the very least.
