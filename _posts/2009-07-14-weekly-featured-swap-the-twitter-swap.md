This week&#8217;s featured swap is [The Twitter Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/41024) hosted by [ladyrose](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ladyrose). The Twitter Swap is a very simple electronic swap in which you send your Twitter username/url to each of your 10 partners. For example, Swapbot has two Twitter accounts that you can follow: [SwapbotNews](http://twitter.com/swapbotNews) and [swapbot](http://twitter.com/swapbot). The swap is open for sign up until August 18th, so even if you do not already have a Twitter account you could create one and start tweeting in anticipation for the swap! 

So what is [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)? &#8220;Twitter is a free service that lets you keep in touch with people through the exchange of quick, frequent answers to one simple question: What are you doing?&#8221; It is really fun and easy way to update friends, or family, or anyone on what you are doing.
