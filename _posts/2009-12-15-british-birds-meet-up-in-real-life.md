It is so awesome when Swap-bot users get together in real life. Recently six members from the met up in the UK for an afternoon tea. Here is a recap of the fun event written by Swap-bot user, :

_We had a lovely time at our British Birds Afternoon Tea Party in Bedford on Saturday, 5th December! There were six swap-botters plus six kiddies, and we each brought along some crafting bits &#8211; plus cakes and sandwiches, of course! At the start of the afternoon we each drew a name out of a hat and then set about crafting a &#8220;Secret Santa&#8221; gift for that person. There&#8217;s a photo of us

It sounds like it was a great event! If anyone else plans a get-together with other Swap-botters, please let me know (rachel[at]swap-bot.com). I would love to feature the event here on the blog.
