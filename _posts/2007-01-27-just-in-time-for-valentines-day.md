 <img id="image38" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/bigheart.png" alt="bigheart.png" />What is this little heart? It happens to be the newest feature of the Swap-bot rating system. Ratings are still based on the 5 point system, but now there is a way to re [Full Mind Control](http://saveyourmoney.on-blog.com/2013/02/17/full-mind-control/ "Full Mind Control") ward those swappers who really go above and beyond the swap expectations. You know the swappers I am talking about &#8211; the ones who send you those super-adorable swap packages, all decorated and filled with extra goodies, or the ones who look at your profile and manage to send you just the PERFECT item. Now you can give those special swappers a heart for being so wonderful. 

This is what the [rating info page](http://www.swap-bot.com/rating_info.php) now says about the heart system:

> If someone sends you an extra special swap package that far exceeds the swap requirements, you can give that person a heart. The option to give someone a heart only appears when you give them the highest rating (&#8220;I got my stuff and it met posted swap requirements&#8221;). Under this rating option a check box will appear that you can mark if you want to give a heart. You do not have to give anyone a heart just because you gave them the highest rating. We suggest that you reserve giving hearts to those swappers who you think deserve even more than the highest rating (more than 5 points). The number of hearts a person has collected will be shown on their profile page next to their average rating. Lots of hearts indicates a very special swapper!

And, don&#8217;t fret, you can go back to your old swaps and retro-actively give hearts to anyone who previously sent you awesome swaps! 

See how many hearts you can collect!
