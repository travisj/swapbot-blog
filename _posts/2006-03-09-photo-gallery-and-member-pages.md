Now that I have gotten some of the little things that Swap-bot needed out of the way, I am ready to focus on a bigger Swap-bot project. I have already started working on a swap photo gallery and member pages.

The member pages are going to be a place where swappers can share info about themselves, like their favorite color or favorite type of music, for swap parters to get possible swap ideas. The member pages will have a place for comments from other swappers and all uploaded images by that user. I have heard from some users that they would like to be able to rank fellow swappers. This would probably be the place for that, I am still working out what exactly could be ranked and how other parts of Swap-bot could use that information.

I am most excited about the photo gallery. Each swap will have its own photo gallery that anyone can view. Swappers would, most likely, upload photos of the swaps they receive (technically they could upload pics of the swaps they send, but that detail will be left up to the swap coordinator). This might be a good place to have some voting. Swappers could vote on the best swap package or something.

Any ideas or feedback regarding member pages and photo galleries would be most appreciated. Thanks.
