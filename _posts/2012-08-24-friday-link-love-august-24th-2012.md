Why in the world does my to-do list always seem to get longer by Friday instead of shorter? Oh well, there is always time for a few good links&#8230;

  * I love candy, so the [colorful art installation](http://www.pipandpop.com.au/#) (like the one seen above) by artists Pip & Pop make me very happy!
  * Free, cute, printable, mini, [quilt block cards from Wild Olive](http://wildolive.blogspot.com/2012/08/printable-quilt-block-cards.html).
  * Yum. &#8220;Rice krispie cereal mixed with Peanut Butter Captain Crunch and tossed with miniature Reeseâ€™s peanut butter cup&#8221; to make [Reeses Rice Krispie Treats](http://www.bakersroyale.com/bars-and-cookie-bars/reeses-rice-krispie-treats/).
  * This [photo series](http://irinawerning.com/back-to-the-fut/back-to-the-future/) is fascinating.
  * Very Pretty! [DIY Daisy Lollipops](http://www.intimateweddings.com/blog/diy-daisy-lollipops/) with real flowers!
  * [The Tiniest Disco Party](http://www.flickr.com/photos/91821907@N00/7698204270/in/pool-93628034@N00) is adorable.
  * Ok. That would work&#8230; How to open a tin can without a can opener.</li> 
    
      * [61 Things Learned At The National Hobo Convention](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/things-i-learned-at-the-national-hobo-convention)
