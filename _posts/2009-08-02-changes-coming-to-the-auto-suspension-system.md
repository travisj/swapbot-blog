In order to make Swap-bot a safer place, we have been listening to user suggestions and have decided to tighten some of the swapping restrictions. The changes we have planned will be implemented in stages so that there is time to adjust and get used to the new system.

The first changes we are making are to the automatic partial suspension system:

Currently, a user is auto suspended (which prevents them from signing up for new swaps and leaving poor ratings) when they have received more than three 1 ratings within the past six months. There is also currently a loophole which prevents users with over a 4.9 rating from being suspended no matter how many 1s they have received. Our very first change will be to remove the 4.9 loophole from the auto suspensions system. That change will be released tonight. That means, that anyone with more than three 1 ratings within the past six months will be auto suspended. The 4.9 loophole was created to protect very prolific swappers, but now that many more people have participated in hundreds of swaps, the loophole seems to be more trouble than help. (Also being released with the changes tonight will be the option for group founders to Dismiss/Cancel pending group invites within their group members page. Finally.)

The second change that will be made to the auto suspension system is to reduce the number of 1 ratings it takes to become auto suspended. We are going to reduce the number of 1s needed for suspension to more than two. That means that once you receive your third 1 rating within six months, you will be automatically partially suspended. This change will happen in a few weeks and there will be more announcements before it happens.

Another change that we are planning for the near future will put more restrictions on who can host a swap. We plan to only allow users to host swaps once they have completed five swaps and received five 5 ratings. This change will be implemented in a few weeks and there will be more info/announcements about the change before it happens.

I hope this early notice will help make these changes go smoothly and not shock anyone too much! They shouldn&#8217;t make too much of a difference to established Swap-bot swappers, but if you do have some recent 1s on your account you might want to work on getting them rectified as soon as possible.

Let us know if you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns.
