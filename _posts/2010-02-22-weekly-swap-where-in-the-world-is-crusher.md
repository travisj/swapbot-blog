_ [of Crusher on the swap page & you can find them on my Flickr , too]. _Next, Print the photo out. Then, cut out Crusher so you end up with just a photo of Crusher. Tip: You may want to reinforce the photo with cardboard or card stock on the back side. Once you have your Crusher likeness, tape a stick to the back (a paint stick works well, so does a wooden spoon or ruler, basically any type of handle will do). Now you have Crusher-on-a-stick.</p> You will take a photograph of your little Crusher-on-a-stick sharing a day with you and send it to your one partner. Crusher can go to the beach with you, show up in your birthday photos, play with your kids, be seen at work with you, or your Crusher-on-a-stick may be sitting in a grocery cart or driving your car. The sky is the limit! Crusher can end up anywhere. For this swap, you just mail your photo of your Crusher-on-a-stick to your partner. However, we would all like to see your photos. You can post them on Flickr at my newly created Swap-bot page, , and I will make a forum thread when the swap starts. </i> I am already signed up for this great swap but you have until March 9th to join. The swap is a &#8220;Type 3&#8221; craft swap that will be sent in the mail, but I would also love to publish the resulting photos here on the blog, too&#8230; Can&#8217;t wait to see where Crusher ends up!
