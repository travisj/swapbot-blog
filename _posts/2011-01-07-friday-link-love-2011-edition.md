Well, it is 2011. I don&#8217;t think I was ready, but here we are. The first link love of the new year&#8230; 

  * Above is an adorable idea for a winter treat from Bakerella: [Milk Men!](http://www.bakerella.com/milk-men/) They sounds really easy, just a small jug of milk topped with a powdered donut hole, but so cute! (Side note: My sister-in-law, Chelsea, made some of Bakerella&#8217;s [cake pops](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/5312635181/) for the holidays and they were awesome! She used the recipe from the [Cake Pops cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811876373?ie=UTF8&tag=bakerella-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0811876373/).)
  * If you have snow in your area, like I do, why not make some [mini snowmen](http://thecraftsdept.marthastewart.com/2011/01/let-it-snow.html)?
  * If you want to be prepared for Valentine&#8217;s Day treats, stock up on those clearance candy canes store are trying to get rid of now. Dabbled has a [round-up of ways to turn them into heart-themed treats](http://dabbled.org/2011/01/buy-now-clearance-candy-canes-for-valentines-treats.html).
  * Need some extra crafty motivation for 2011? Join [Iron Craft](http://theironcraft.blogspot.com/)! It is a full year of weekly craft challenges.
  * I&#8217;m intrigued: [a recipe for homemade Nutella](http://bonvivant.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/the-season-for-giving/).
  * This also looks interesting: A tutorial for making your own [Mod Podged tile coasters](http://mychiclife.com/2011/01/07/tile-and-error/) on My Chic Life. 
      * Swap-bot user, [Titancia](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:titancia) tipped me off to the amazing [&#8220;paper planes&#8221; on cloth-ears](http://cloth-ears.co.uk/Products/Bags/paper_plane_collection.html). All of the items &#8212; like wallets, mugs, and tote bags &#8212; are decorated in Swap-bot-esque mail theme. Great stuff for snail mail lovers!
      * If you are hosting any type of party in the near future, you must check out [TOPS Malibu](http://topsmalibu.com/index.php) for fun party favors, decorations, and candles. 
      * For a child&#8217;s party, I think this [cookie crown cake](http://familyfun.go.com/recipes/cookie-crown-cake-688652/) would be a huge hit!
      * And if you are attending any parties, any of this [DIY sequin jewelry](http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/jewelry-and-jewelry-storage?lpgStart=1&currentslide=1&currentChapter=1) from the Martha Stewart Crafts Dept would be a fab accessory!</ul>
