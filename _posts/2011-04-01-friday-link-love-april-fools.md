I wish I had a fun April Fools&#8217; Day joke for you today, but I am not very good at those. I am so gullible that I always fall for pranks and jokes on the first day of April&#8230; so, please be kind!

Even though it is tricky day, I still wanted to share some seriously cool links. Have fun!

  * I think that Fabric Stitchy Bookmark seen above is so cute (it&#8217;s the little deer fabric that does it). [Get the How To on Craft Leftovers.](http://www.craftleftovers.com/blog/archives/6485)
  * We all love the postal mail, but what about faux snail mail? I just discovered this site, [Paperless Post](http://www.paperlesspost.com/). It basically allows you to create and send really beautiful virtual letters (complete with virtual envelopes) via the internet. The catch is that it isn&#8217;t free&#8230; hmmm&#8230; Would you pay to send online mail?
  * [JamieToohey](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:JamieToohey) is a new user of Swap-bot and she recently [posted on her blog, Crafty is Awesome, about Swap-bot](http://craftyawesomeness.blogspot.com/2011/04/swap-bot.html). Love it!
  * Oh, man. Yum! [Bacon Cinnamon Rolls!](http://rainydaygal.com/?p=953)
  * And another recipe: [Make your own sprinkles](http://www.kitchendaily.com/2011/02/24/cake-sprinkles/).
  * I love this: [The Colour Clock](http://thecolourclock.co.uk/). It is a design lover&#8217;s screensaver.
  * Two cute Easter/spring projects: [Design*Sponge pin and bead basket](http://www.designspongeonline.com/2011/03/diy-project-bead-and-pin-baskets.html) and an [upcycled basket on Michele Made Me](http://michelemademe.blogspot.com/2011/03/nest-basket-i-do-not-know.html).

And a few April Fools links:

  * [The hottest new crafting material is dryer lint?](http://www.craftcritique.com/2011/04/hottest-new-crafting-material.html)
  * Martha Stewart&#8217;s funny and harmless [April Fools&#8217; Day pranks](http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/april-fools-day-tricks).
  * [How-to make a fake glass of spilled milk on Dollar Store Crafts.](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2011/04/make-a-fake-glass-of-spilled-milk/)
  * Ok, this one isn&#8217;t an April Fools&#8217; joke, but it is definitely odd: [Man Makes Beautiful Quilt of Women&#8217;s Panties](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/03/man_makes_beaut.php).

So, have you encountered any good pranks today?
