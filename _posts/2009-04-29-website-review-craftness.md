[<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/picture-2.png" alt="" title="picture-2" width="235" height="70" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-723" />](http://www.craftness.com/)I stumbled upon the [Craftness](http://www.craftness.com/) site while reading some crafty blogs, and despite its simplicity it looks like a very fun concept. From the site description: &#8220;Craftness.com is a craft challenge site, every week a fresh challenge will be presented. Our community rate crafts and choose the winning artists and designers. We welcome you to join our challenge and craft using your weapon of choice: Ceramic, Needlecraft, Knitting, Jewelry, Fashion or Crochet using Metal Glass or Wood, all crafts are welcome.&#8221;

From what I can determine, there is a new craft challenge presented on [Craftness](http://www.craftness.com/) every week. Crafters of all types are invited to enter the challenge contest with their completed craft projects. Then, the site users vote on the winners. The winning projects are featured on the site&#8217;s front page and there are prizes! This week&#8217;s challenge is &#8220;Homage to the 70s&#8221; and the winner receives $100 from [MisterArt](http://www.misterart.com/greeting_cj.cfm?affiliate.cfm?ap=cj,6,1:4&AID=42551&PID=3228816). I have not tried uploading a project, so I am not entirely clear on how the process works. There is also very limited information on the site, so it is hard to determine how often it is updated&#8230; Has anyone else tried out [Craftness](http://www.craftness.com/)?
