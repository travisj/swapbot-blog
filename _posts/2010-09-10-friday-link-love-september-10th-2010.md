yippee! It is Friday! I have a packed weekend coming up, but it should be fun. What will you be doing this weekend? Make sure to leave some time to check out all these crafty links&#8230;

  * The [cupcake toppers swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/70014) hosted by [thehappyhoneybee](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:thehappyhoneybee) was so fun! I made the toppers you see above, and you can [check out more of the lovely finished toppers on thehappyhoneybee&#8217;s blog.](http://thehappyhoneybee.blogspot.com/2010/09/more-cupcake-toppers.html) Such a fun and fast craft!
  * MarthaStewart.com has rounded up all of their [Best Clip Art](http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/clip-art-and-templates) in one handy spot. 
  * Strange: [14 Cool and Innovative Scissors](http://www.toxel.com/tech/2010/09/03/14-cool-and-innovative-scissors/)
  * I just discovered this beautiful online shop: [Olive Manna](http://www.olivemannashop.com/). It sells all sorts of packaging and craft supplies.
  * And a newly discovered blog: [Howd.i.y!](http://howdiy.wordpress.com/) 
  * I thought this [ruffle messenger bag](http://madebynight.blogspot.com/2010/09/le-tuto-de-la-besace-fronceetutorial.html) was too pretty not to share&#8230; and the tutorial comes in both French and English!</a>
