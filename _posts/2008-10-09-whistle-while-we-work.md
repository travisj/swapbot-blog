Hi swappers! Yesterday and today were my first two days as a &#8220;real&#8221; Swap-bot employee! I have cut back on my graphic design job in order to devote more time to managing and improving Swap-bot. I am very excited to be making this change, but also a bit nervous because of how shaky the economy is right now&#8230; Anyway, I just wanted to give everyone a head&#8217;s up on my admin activities. Right now I am still trying to catch up on all of the support emails and personal messages. I think I have made some good progress, but there may be some past emails and messages that I may never get to. I don&#8217;t want to declare email bankruptcy, but I may need to cut my losses at some point. If you wrote to me regarding a problem within the last two months and you never heard form me, I suggest sending me another email. You know, just in case&#8230; Contact me at questions [at] swap-bot.com. I have been answering emails constantly for the past two months, but they sometimes got out of my control&#8230; Hopefully I can keep things in check from now on! 

OK, back to work! xoxo<em style="display:none"><a href="http://londongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/?domino">Domino move</a></em>
