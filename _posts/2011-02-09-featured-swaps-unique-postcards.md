Postcards are such fun, easy, quick things to swap. This week I found two unique postcard swaps to share with you:

[**Hablamos Espanol**](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/83158) &#8211; For this swap, hosted by [ssshauna](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ssshauna), you send one postcard (in an envelope) to your one partner with a message written in Spanish on it. Sign up before February 21st.

[**Pi Day Cards**](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/79339) &#8211; Did you know that March 14th is Pi Day? If you are a match lover, sign up for this swap hosted by [thesuester](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:thesuester) and make or buy a Pi-themed postcard for your partner. Sign up before February 23rd.

Both swaps are international and have only one partner. You are allowed to send traditional style greeting cards for each swap, if you prefer. Both swaps allow new users.
