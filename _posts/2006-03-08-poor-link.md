I got an email from [Amy](http://www.purplepinkandorange.com/) (our most prolific swap coordinator) yesterday and she told me:

> i did get the e-mail reminder, but it seemed when you clicked on the link inside it didn&#8217;t take you to a helpful place.

I went to the link that swap participants got and couldn&#8217;t figure out why it wasn&#8217;t helpful. I logged out and went to the link again. I then realized that if you view the swap details page without being logged in you can&#8217;t see the link to view your swap partners. Anyways, tonight I changed the link that gets sent out in the emails. If the participant is not logged in when they go to the swap details page, they are redirected to the login page. After logging in, the are then redirected back to the swap details page.
