Swapping and penpalling are a little bit different, but snail mail lovers (like us!) often enjoy both&#8230; so, I think you will be excited about this new website and club I just discovered: **[The League of Extraordinary Penpals!](http://www.extraordinarypenpals.com/)**

**What is the LEP?**
  
Basically, itâ€™s a penpal club that connects you with other extraordinary penpals. The LEP is a super collaboration between [Laura](http://www.pleasedeliverto.com/) aka Super Squirrel and [Julie](http://penpaloftheweek.com/) aka Super Sushi, and they need awesome penpals like you to join their ranks! 

**What do I get for joining the LEP?**
  
In addition to being part of a club that has the word &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; in the title, the LEP offers a monthly newsletter that contains all of the below in every issue:

Printable &#8211; Snail mail challenge &#8211; Organized swap &#8211; Giveaway &#8211; Superhero-themed interview with an extraordinary LEP member &#8211; Article on a topic of interest &#8211; Featured snail mail related website &#8211; Access to a private stationery subscription service &#8211; The chance to receive a letter or a card from your LEP hostesses &#8211; The chance to be featured as our monthly extraordinary LEP member, which includes an awesome superhero portrait by Ciara Kay &#8211; Also, there will be a LEP-themed letter set that will be available only to LEP members!
