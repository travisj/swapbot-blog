We have just released a few site changes. We added total number of completed swaps to everyoneâ€™s profiles and we changed it so that the swaps you are currently hosting are not removed from the corresponding profile list until the mail deadline has passed. (Travis also made some changes that should speed up the entire site a bit.) However, the most important change is the addition of an \*\*automatic account suspension system\*\*.

This computerized system will automatically partially suspend questionable swappers if they compile too many \*\*&#8221;1&#8243;\*\* (did not receive swap items) ratings. Partial suspensions means that the user is dropped from all open swaps (in which partners have not been assigned) and the user is no longer able to sign up for new swaps. They can still complete current swaps and leave ratings, and when/if they reduce their number of â€œ1â€³ ratings their account will automatically be UN-suspended. 

Right now the suspension criteria used by the system is very lenient. Only users who have received \*\*ten\*\* â€œ1â€³ ratings in the last six months will be automatically suspended. We plan to change this criteria soon, but we wanted to give everyone a heads up that the system is now in place before implementing the actual criteria. In a week, or so, we will change the automatic suspension criteria to just \*\*four\*\* â€œ1â€³ ratings in the last six months. If your account fits this criteria, I would suggest trying to rectify some of your bad ratings. Contact old swap partners and re-send packages if necessary. I believe that four â€œ1â€³ ratings is still quite lenient, but we will see how the system plays out before making it more strict.

Also, if you have over a 4.9 rating you will never be considered by the computer for the automatic suspension. However, anyone with under a 4.9 rating and who has had four &#8220;1&#8221; ratings in the last six months will be partially suspended. We added this high rating &#8220;safety&#8221; so that users who participate in many, many swaps have more leniency in the number of &#8220;1&#8221;s they can have on their account at any given time. (FYI: A user has to have completed almost 200 swaps in order to &#8220;beat&#8221; the system with a 4.9 rating.)

Thank you all for your feedback on this issue. (Check out the original discussion of this feature [here](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/4607/).)<u style="display:none">[Barbie as the Island Princess dvd](http://utero.pe/?barbie_as_the_island_princess)</u>
