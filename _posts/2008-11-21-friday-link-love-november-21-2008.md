Woah, Thanksgiving is next week! Wild! I don&#8217;t really have any Thanksgiving-ish links for you today, but here are some other cool things to check out. Have fun!

  * These [Holiday Mailing Secrets](http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Projects-&-Ideas/Ideas-for-Work/Mailing/Articles/Holiday-Mailing-Secrets-Revealed.htm?ic_campID=4&ic_pkw=nov2008-work_HolidayMailingSecrets&cmp_ID=email-nov2008-work_HolidayMailingSecrets) from Avery are very helpful. Remember, mail times get much longer as the holidays approach. Take that into account when sending out your swaps. (This great link was submitted by [muincat](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Muincat).)
  * Speaking of the holidays, [not martha has a good list of gift ideas](http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2008/11/18/holiday-gift-ideas/) that features things she has reviewed on her blog throughout the year. There are ideas that would work for a wide variety of different types of people. 
  * I am just loving this: [Elizabeth Holcombe&#8217;s Holiday Corsage tutorial](http://elizabethholcombe.typepad.com/elizabeth_holcombe_whimsi/2008/11/make-a-lush-holiday-corsage.html). Her corsages are so fun and wild! 
  * Have you heard of [Spoonflower](http://www.spoonflower.com/welcome) ? It is custom fabric company where you can have your own designs printed on fabric. It recently opened up to the public, so no anyone can create their own custom fabric! 
  * Just for giggles: [Horny Bacon](http://hornybacon.com/) &#8211; a blog all about bacon!
  * Remember! Today is the very last day to enter the [November Swap-bot Giveaway](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/11/09/november-giveaway-enter-to-win/) for the Xyron sticker maker. You have to comment on that blog entry to be entered. Good luck!
