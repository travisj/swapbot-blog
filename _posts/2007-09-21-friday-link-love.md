_This is another new weekly feature I hope to continue. I plan to gather links to fun, crafty, helpful, or interesting content throughout the week and then post them all for you here on Friday. If you have any suggestions for links I should feature, please email me at rachel [at] swap-bot [dot] com._

Links for you:

  * [Almost Naked Animals](http://almostnakedanimals.com/) &#8211; Noah Z. Jones&#8217; funny, cute, clever illustrations of animals in underpants. He posts a new one each week.
  * A crazy-huge cable knit rug created by <a href=http://www.theseflocks.com/">Flocks</a> and seen on the [Craft:blog](http://www.craftzine.com/blog/archive/2007/09/cableknit_rug.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954).
  * An amazing way to display your pez collection on [One Good Bumblebee](http://www.onegoodbumblebee.com/blog/?p=2990).
  * [Made It](http://www.madeit.com.au/) &#8211; an Australian Etsy-type marketplace which sells work by independent artist, crafters, and makers.
