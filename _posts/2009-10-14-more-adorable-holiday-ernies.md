Check out these additional Ernie the Envie altered graphics created by Swap-bot user, . She says she just can&#8217;t stop making new Ernies! I love them. They are all so crisp and professional&#8230; not to mention cute! I especially like these Halloween ones&#8230; I guess I am just in the Halloween spirit.

You&#8217;ve already seen &#8220;Happy Holiday&#8221; Ernie, but look at how sweet he is as the Easter bunny and in love for Valentine&#8217;s Day:
