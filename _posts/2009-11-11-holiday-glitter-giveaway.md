It is holiday giveaway time! I have three awesome sets to send to three lucky winners. I love Martha&#8217;s glitter (find out how much ) and these sets have a great variety of normal super-fine glitter, tinsel glitter, and glass microbead glitter &#8211; all in beautiful holiday colors. So sparkly!

So, how do you win one of these fab glitter sets? It is easy. Simply, spread the word about all of the winter and holiday swaps taking place on Swap-bot right now. Post on your blog or twitter account about a swap that you are participating in (or just one that you think others might be interested in), then make a comment on this post that includes your Swap-bot username and a link to your tweet or post about Swap-bot. Your comment here will enter you in the random drawing for one of the glitter sets.
