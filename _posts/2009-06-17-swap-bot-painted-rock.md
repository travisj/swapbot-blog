Check out this little cutie! It is a very small rock (less than an inch on its longest side) painted with Ernie the envie. It was sent to me by <a href=http://www.swap-bot.com/user:FOOF4E">FOOF4E</a> as a little extra in a swap package and I absolutely love it! This photo is actually much larger than its real-life size. It is miniature!
