Look at all those Swap-bot goodies! Wouldn&#8217;t you like to receive that pack in the mail?! 

There is still time! Donate $5 (or more) to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society through my [Team in Training fundraising page](http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/nyc10/rjohnsochx) and the swag pack is yours! I ([racheljohnson](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson), your Swap-bot Admin) am training for the NYC marathon with Team in Training while simultaneously raising money for the LLS. Many Swap-bot members have already donated &#8211; in fact I have already sent out more than 70 packs! &#8211; and I greatly appreciate the support. I just wanted to announce the swag pack bonus again today because **I will only be continuing this offer through the end of October**. 

Here are the details of what you will receive in your swag pack:

  * 7 Ernie the Envie postcards
  * 2 &#8220;Love Snail Mail&#8221; postcards
  * 1 original Swap-bot postcard &#8211; these are in limited supply!
  * 4 Swap-bot 1&#8243; buttons &#8211; 2 of each style
  * 3 two-inch square Swap-bot stickers

**Donate Now!</a>** </p> 

All donations go toward the mission of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, to find a cure for all blood cancers and to support patients and their families while they are fighting the diseases.

That is me running over the Manhattan Bridge last weekend. The New York City Marathon is exactly one month away, on November 7th! I am extremely excited, but I&#8217;m also getting nervous.
