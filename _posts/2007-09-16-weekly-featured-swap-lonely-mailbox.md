<img class="alignright" src='http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/images.jpg' alt='images.jpg' />This is the first time I have featured a letter swap, but I couldn't pass up the [Lonely Mailbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6908) for this week. This swap, hosted by <a href=http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=7973">Chickpea</a> 

<div style="display:none">

</div>

, is international and open to **new swappers**. All users with a filled out profiles are welcome!

For this swap each participant has one partner to whom they send seven letters &#8211; one for each day of the week. Participating in Lonely Mailbox will ensure that you (and your partner) receive lots of mail!

Each day has a letter theme:

  * **Day 1.** Basic introduction. 
  * **Day 2.** Wha <div style="display: none">
      <a href="http://howtousemyipad.com/" title="using an ipad for work">using an ipad for work</a>
    </div>
    
    t are you passionate about?</li> 
    
      * **Day 3.** What is your favorite book? 
      * **Day 4.** Where would you most love to travel?
      * **Day 5.** Tell your partner about five things you'd like to accomplish.
      * **Day 6.** Send one envelope filled with little goodies&#8211;stickers, cards, stationery, etc. **Plus,** send a second envelope and write Sunday on the outside of this envelope, so that your partner knows to save it and open it on Sunday! Tell your partner about your average weekend.</ul> 
    
    Make sure to read the entire [swap description](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6908) before signing up. This swap is inexpensive and easy, but it does entail a good amount of commitment since a letter must be mailed everyday for a week. What a wonderful way to find a new pen pal! 
    
    Have fun checking your mailbox!
