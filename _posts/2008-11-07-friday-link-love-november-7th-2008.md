Finally the presidential election is behind us! I am so burnt out on political stuff that all I want to share with you today are fun, artsy, crafty links. Enjoy!

  * Let&#8217;s all take a moment to be nice to one another. [Operation Nice](http://www.operationnice.com/) has tons of ideas on how to work niceness into your life. We could all use a little bit more nice!
  * Like winning free stuff? Visit [Bloggy Giveaways](http://www.donttrythisathome.typepad.com/bloggy_giveaways/) to find out about all sorts of giveaways going on across the interwebs!
  * [Design For Mankind](http://www.designformankind.com/) &#8211; a blog about fine art and design. Beautiful site with lovely photos, interviews, lists, and links. Also, publisher of [Mankind magazine](http://www.designformankind.com/2008/11/mankind-mag-issue-five/).
  * Just found out about another handmade marketplace: [Folksy](http://www.folksy.com/). It is like etsy, but for the UK. Prices are in pounds.
  * Yes, it is already time to start thinking about the holidays. Check out the [purplepinkandorange Holiday Gift Guide](http://www.purplepinkandorange.com/giftguide/index.php) for a little help and inspiration.
  * Speaking of the holidays, artists and crafters must check out the [Modish Holiday Marketing Tips](http://www.modishblog.com/modish/2008/11/modish-marketin.html). It is a great overview on how to improve your handmade business for the holiday shopping season.

Have a lovely weekend! xoxo
