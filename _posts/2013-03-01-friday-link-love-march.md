Isn't that snail drawing incredible! It was sent to me by [marge](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:marge) in the Philippines. I love it! Snail mail never fails to delight me. 

How about a few fun TGIF links?

  * Did you know that [March is National Craft Month](https://www.craftandhobby.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?WebKey=21740220-3565-4CB3-BA31-A7E46FB8DBAD)?!
  * Now, sometimes I think super-organized themed parties are a bit over-the-top, but this [hot air balloon birthday is pretty darn cute](http://blog.amyatlas.com/2013/02/22/up-up-and-away-guest-dessert-feature-2/).
  * Love this fashionable [DIY Tassel Necklace](http://sugarandcloth.com/2013/02/diy-tassel-necklace/) from Sugar & Cloth.
  * I need to get out my sewing machine! Diane of [CraftyPod](http://www.craftypod.com/2013/02/20/how-to-make-a-kaleidoscope-pillow-a-guest-tutorial-for-spoonflower/) shows us [How to Make a Kaleidoscope Pillow](http://blog.spoonflower.com/2013/02/fat-quarter-february-kaleidoscope-pillows.html) with just two fat quarters of fabric.

  * Make this pretty [Glitter Jewelry Dish](http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2013/02/gold-glitter-jewelry-dish-project.html). 
  * You already know that I love [My Zoetrope](http://www.etsy.com/shop/MyZoetrope?ref=seller_info), but did you know you can get the cute illustrations as [temporary tattoos](http://www.etsy.com/listing/99238006/temporary-tattoos-set-of-5-unicorn-cat)?!
