It has been way longer than I would have liked since I [last posted](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2014/12/19/friday-link-love-december-18th-2014/) a Friday Link Love (1/3 of a year!!) but I am happy to share a few fun, crafty, pretty links with you once again. Enjoy!

  * Mother&#8217;s Day is coming up! (It will be my first one as a mom &#8212; wow!) These [DIY Fingerprint Necklaces](http://www.sarahortega.com/2011/05/diy-fingerprint-jewelry.html) would make a great, crafty gift.
  * Find lots more Mother&#8217;s Day craft ideas in [this round-up of 20 keepsake craft ideas on I Heart Arts n Crafts](http://www.iheartartsncrafts.com/20-mothers-day-keepsake-gifts-that-kids-can-make/). (Like the cute [cupcake liner cards](http://www.iheartcraftythings.com/2015/03/simple-kid-made-mothers-day-card.html?spref=pi) seen above.)
  * These [DIY Gelatin Confetti Sprinkles](http://www.sprinklebakes.com/2015/04/diy-gelatin-confetti-sprinkles.html) for topping desserts are so pretty it is unreal! 
  * Have you heard of [Pocket Letters](http://janettelane.blogspot.com/2015/02/what-are-pocket-letters.html)? They are a fun, new, crafty, snail mail idea. You send letters and goodies using a 9-slot ATC pocket protector sheet. Pocket Letters are being swapped on the &#8216;bot! If you are interested, check out this [International Pocket Letter Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/198308) (Sign up ends today!!) or this [Pocket Letter Color Combos Swap Series](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/199510).
  * Dollar Store Crafts shares [10 Cute Garden Crafts for Spring](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2015/03/10-cute-garden-crafts-for-your-spring-garden/).
  * Check out this adult [Craft-a-way Camp](http://craftawaycamp.weebly.com). Look fun!
  * Mail postcards for social change with [Globalbility.org](http://en.globalbility.org).
  * This looks like a really fun blog: [C.R.A.F.T.](http://www.creatingreallyawesomefreethings.com)
  * I think I am going to try and make this [Snickerdoodle Apple Bread](http://cookiesandcups.com/snickerdoodle-apple-bread/) this weekend&#8230; it looks so good!
  * And of course, a Link Love wouldn&#8217;t be complete without a S&#8217;mores recipe: [Ultimate S&#8217;mores Bars!](http://hipfoodiemom.com/2012/06/02/whoah-big-daddy-ultimate-smores-bars/)
