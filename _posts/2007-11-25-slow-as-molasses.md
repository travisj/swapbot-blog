I think everyone has noticed that Swap-bot is super slow today. Travis has been trying to figure it out. He first thought it could have to do with the recent site changes, but it turns out that our hosting company (MediaTemple) is having <a href=http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/web-latency-on-gs-gridcluster1/">&#8220;latency issues&#8221;</a> with the server Swap-bot uses. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Hopefully things will be running fast again soon!
