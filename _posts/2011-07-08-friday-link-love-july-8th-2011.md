I&#8217;m back with your lovely Friday links!

  * The cute ice cream cones you see above are actually [FREE downloadable gift tags from Eat Drink Chic](http://www.eatdrinkchic.com/post.cfm/free-ice-cream-gift-tags). Great for a summer party!
  * The last Harry Potter movie is coming out on the 15th!! If you are a fan or just need a refresher of the full Harry Potter saga you will love [illustrator, Lucy Knisley&#8217;s, condensed, comic book rendition of all seven books](http://lucylou.livejournal.com/596984.html). 
  * For matchbox lovers: Check out this [matchbox decorating tutorial and free matchbox sleeve downloads](http://www.microjivvy.com/miniature-keepsake-boxes) on Doll House MIniatures. (thanks to [cobaltgypsy](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cobaltgypsy) for the link!)
  * I found a new lifestyle/design/handmade blog that I think you will like: [Stamp 48](http://www.stamp48.com/).
  * Since we are all snail mail lovers, this [Photoshop tutorial on how to create an authentic-looking postmark](http://www.fuzzimo.com/photoshop-tutorial-old-postmark-stamp/) might come in handy for digital scrapbooking or design work.
  * You know about cake pops, right? They are just about THE most popular dessert right now, and Bakerella is the queen of cake pops. Check out her [round-up of amazing cake pop creations made by her blog readers and fans](http://www.bakerella.com/pop-stars-post/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Bakerella+%28Bakerella%29). The Diet Coke can cake pops are hilarious! 
  * Speaking of pop-like desserts, how about some [Campfire S&#8217;more Pops](http://bestfriendsforfrosting.com/2011/05/how-to-make-toasted-campfire-smore-pops/)! (You know the Link Love wouldn&#8217;t be complete without a S&#8217;more link!)
  * One more food link&#8230; Technically, these crazy cookies were meant for the Fourth of July, but I think you could adjust the color scheme to fit any holiday or party: [Explosive Pop Rocks Cookies from CakeSpy.com](http://www.cakespy.com/blog/2009/7/3/snap-crackle-and-pop-rocks-explosively-delicious-fourth-of-j.html). 
      * Do you like keeping track of the restaurants and places that you have visited or want to visit? Then you should check out [GuideMe](http://guideme.com/)! GuideMe can act as your online “to do” list of restaurants and attractions. You can import your Foursquare checkins and make reservations with OpenTable all through GuideMe. They also just launched a helpful feature: deal tracking. Add places to your “Guide List” and GuideMe now monitors hundreds of daily deal services and will alert you if a deal exists for a place on your List!
      * Do you wish you could visit New York City? Well, I have the next best thing&#8230; well, not really, but you should still read my [detailed review of a Lower East Side Food Tour](http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=4181) I took on Saturday. We sampled a wide variety of food and learned about the immigrant history of NY. </ul> 
    Happy Friday!! What are you up to today? (I have to take [Crusher](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:crusher) to the vet this morning, so he may not have the happiest day&#8230;)
