And I regret that I still have not introduced all of the awesome participants yet&#8230; but I will rectify that over the next few weeks with ten more intro blog posts. The Ambassadors are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities. If you are interested in representing Swap-bot in your area and sending out Swap-bot swag, stay tuned for info about our upcoming second round of Ambassador applications._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [BeeMGee](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:BeeMGee)!** BeeMGee lives in Victor Harbor in South Australia, and is a mother and school teacher. She has been swapping on Swap-bot for more than two years and loves paper crafting.

**How BeeMGee found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I found Swap bot when a Facebook swap for a valentine card became too big and the organizers asked to join swap-bot.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I belong to many groups on Swap-bot and host a regional group here in Australia (Vintage Cards and Crafts &#8211; Australia). I participate in several group forums and have made lifelong friends who, sadly, I shall probably never meet in person. I log in to swap-bot several times a day.&#8221; 

&#8220;I consider Swap-bot to be a fantastic site to swap on particularly because of the rating system and inbuilt controls. I belong to several facebook sites where there is no accountability and people are left disappointed with being unable to have some guarantee they will receive a swap.&#8221; 

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;I mainly swap Type 3 swaps &#8211; ATCs, cards, tags, rolos.&#8221; 

**Her motivation for crafting:** &#8220;I find crafting incredibly therapeutic&#8230; I love creating, but designing and producing for myself would be pointless. I love the thought of bringing joy to others. That thrill of receiving an addressed envelope and wondering what treasures are enclosed. I know this may sound trite but I am more interested in giving to others than receiving. Of course, I love what I am sent, but hope I am able to bring a little happiness into othersâ€™ lives. The benefit of receiving from others has been the wonderful techniques I have learned from them, and of course, their work is inspirational in future swaps.&#8221;
