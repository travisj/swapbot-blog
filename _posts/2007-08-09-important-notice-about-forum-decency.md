Because of a few recent forum threads and many email complaints from users, I have determined it is necessary to post a bit of info about forum etiquette. 

First of all, we love how active everyone is in the forums. It is wonderful when we see people answering questions and helping new users. Our policy is to NOT censor any forum posts or delete any threads. Each user is responsible for what they post to the forums&#8230; That is where things can get tricky! 

Please be aware that members could be held legally responsible for damages to another member's reputation if a court were to find that the remarks constitute libel or defamation. Under federal law &#8211; [Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act) &#8211; because Swap-bot does not censor feedback or investigate it for accuracy, Swap-bot is not legally responsible for the remarks that members post, even if those remarks are defamatory. However, this law does not protect the person who leaves the feedback from responsibility for it.

Basically, you are just as responsible for remarks you make in the Swap-bot forums as you are for things you say to so

meone's face or print in a publication. I know that bad swappers make us super-mad and frustrated, but we all have to try our best to remain civil and kind.

One more thing: although we created a &#8220;One-on-One Trades&#8221; category in the forums, Swap-bot cannot regulate these swaps and I cannot make sure that members send their items for these swaps. We are currently working on a way to incorporate one-on-one trades and tag-type swaps into the overall Swap-bot system and rating system, but it will take us a while to get it implemented. Until then, you are participating in the forum swaps completely at your own risk without any type of recourse (i.e. the rating system) available if you don't receive items. Because we do not regulate these types of swaps, I cannot take the forum swaps into consideration when deciding whether someone needs to have their account frozen or deleted. 

There are so many awesome, kind, creative, and fabulous users on Swap-bot. Don't let the few scammers get you down! We are trying our best to stay on top of them. 

Thank you all for your help and happy swapping!
