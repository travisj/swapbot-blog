If you read my [personal blog](http://www.rljart.com/blog/) or follow my personal [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/rljart), you know that I attended the [BlogHer](http://www.blogher.com/conferences) conference last weekend in New York. I was not sure what to expect, but since it was hosted near me this year I decided to give it a try. I was hoping to network and spread the good word about Swap-bot. It turns out that there weren&#8217;t a ton of art and craft bloggers there, but I did get to do plenty of networking with cool women and I attended some informative classes. Below are some of the links I collected along the way&#8230;

**GIVEAWAY**

I also picked up a bunch of free swag at the conference. In the expo area companies were handing out free product like it was candy! (And, some of it was candy.) I have a very random group of swag to GIVE AWAY to one person&#8230; The package will include a Microsoft tote bag, a Cherrios T-shirt (adult size medium), an Arm & Hammer mouse pad, a new Febreze &#8220;Set and Refresh,&#8221; a Firefox keychain, a unicorn lollipop, some Downey fabric softener, a General Mills pocket mirror, an AOL pocket notepad and pen, hand sanitizer from Yahoo!, an Etsy party favor pack with lip gloss and pins, and the BIG PRIZE: a $10 gift card to Toys R Us! To enter to win this really bizarre &#8211; but great, right? &#8211; collection of goodies, comment on this post with a link to one of your favorite craft blogs or female bloggers. 

You must include your Swap-bot username in your comment. The drawing will be open for entry until Wednesday, August 18th. I will randomly select and announce the winner next Thursday.
