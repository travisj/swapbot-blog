It is a hard question, but fun to think about. And, what better time than the holidays to reminisce and read about some of the best gifts ever? Join the most recent in the [Postcard Confessions swap series](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/78556) hosted by [thehappyhoneybee](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:thehappyhoneybee) and you can do just that. 

From the [Postcard Confessions &#8211; Best Gift Ever swap description](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/78556):

_It&#8217;s time for Postcard Confessions, round five! &#8216;Tis the season of giving&#8230;so what&#8217;s the best gift you&#8217;ve ever given someone else?</p> 

Write a note to your partner describing the most wonderful gift you&#8217;ve ever given another person. Maybe you knitted something that was exactly what your mother wanted, maybe you put together an amazingly creative package for your partner, or maybe you gave something very simple&#8230;but it had an incredibly meaningful impact upon the other person.

It&#8217;s nice to hear stories of kindness and generosity around this time of year&#8230;and perhaps you&#8217;ll receive some ideas for gift-giving yourself!

Postcards are sender&#8217;s choice and can be handmade, clean vintage, or store-bought, but please be sure to send a card that you&#8217;d like to receive. Choosing a postcard illustrating the theme or season is nice, but not strictly required. They should be written on and stamped (no envelope), and everyone will have 1 partner, with 1 postcard to send. Easy peasy.</i>

The swap is open to anyone with a well-filled out profile, but make sure you sign up before this Saturday, December 11th!
