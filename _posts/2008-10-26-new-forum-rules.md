The forums are a great place to chat with friends, ask questions, and learn about Swap-bot, but in the past arguments and disruptive content have made the forums unpleasant for many users. We have now posted some new, straightforward Forum Rules for all of us to follow. They are very similar to rules enforced on other major internet discussion boards and forums. Swap-bot Admins (Rachel & Travis) will be taking a stricter stance on the rules and a more active role in closing threads and restricting forum access for problem users. We stand by our commitment to free speech and non-censorship, while also working to provide a safe and fun discussion environment. A shorter version of the new rules is below, but please read the entire [Forum Rules](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums_info.php) page asap!

**Forum Rules of Conduct**

Violations of the following rules may result in a temporary or indefinite forum ban. Extreme violations may result in a partial or full account suspension. Forum bans and account suspensions can happen with or without warning and are at the discretion of Swap-bot Admins.

  * Hate-speak and disruptive or hostile comments are not allowed.
  * Threats of violence (against yourself or others) and personal attacks are not allowed.
  * Using the forums as a way to Spam other members or advertise unrelated goods or services is not allowed.
  * Posting another person&#8217;s address or contact information (including email address) is not allowed.
  * Making repetitive or disruptive posts and repetitively &#8220;bumping&#8221; threads is not allowed.
  * The use of false or duplicate accounts (also called &#8220;sock puppets&#8221;) in the Swap-bot Forums for the purpose of disruption or to avoid detection is not allowed.
  * Posting copyrighted content without the permission of the copyright owner is not allowed. This includes posting private messages or email content without the author&#8217;s consent.
  * Maliciously and/or falsely posting a user in the Questionable Swapper category is not allowed.

Forum posts containing the following types of content may be closed by Swap-bot Admins:

  * Interpersonal disputes or arguments unrelated to Swap-bot
  * Vulgar, obscene, or pornographic text or images
  * Repetitive or hostile arguments
  * Offensive or disruptive content that upsets other users
  * Any type of comment making fun of Crusher, the Swap-bot mascot!

Despite our best efforts to make these rules as specific as possible, there are still many gray areas. Our goal is NOT to be the etiquette or profanity police. Swap-bot is an adult site and therefore an appropriate level of adult content and language is fine. All enforcement and interpretation of the forum rules will be done by the Swap-bot Admins at their discretion.

The new rules are not retroactive. We are not going to sift through old posts looking for rule-breakers. Also, because these are new policies, we have removed the previous forum restrictions placed on users. Everyone gets a clean slate. However, new forum bans will be permanent, so do NOT break the rules.
