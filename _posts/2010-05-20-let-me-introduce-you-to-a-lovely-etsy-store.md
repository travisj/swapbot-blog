Swap-bot users [RobinT](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:RobinT) and [cbpoole](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cbpoole) have joined together to create a new Etsy store called [Letters Mingle Souls](http://www.etsy.com/shop/lettersminglesouls). Robin and Blair have some lovely paper craft items for sale, like [handmade envelopes](http://www.etsy.com/listing/47538436/set-of-10-handmade-envious-envelopes) and beautiful [ATC sleeves](http://www.etsy.com/listing/47646368/atc-sleeves-business-card-holder), but they also have something even more special in their shop. They are selling handmade [Lymphoma Awareness ribbons](http://www.etsy.com/listing/47543298/lymphoma-awareness-ribbon-lime-green) in honor of their friend and fellow Swap-bot member, April ([rainbowafterrain81](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:rainbowafterrain81)). April was recently diagnosed with lymphoma and is currently undergoing treatment. (You can read more about her experience on [her blog](http://aprilbest1981.blogspot.com/).) The ribbons are very pretty and all proceeds from their sale (minus the cost of shipping) will toward April&#8217;s cancer treatment and care. I&#8217;ve already purchased mine!

You may also recall that Blair (cbpoole) has been organizing the [Official Swap-bot Cookbook](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/05/10/official-swap-bot-cookbook/). It is a big project and she recently reported that she has over 100 recipes for the book! When it is completed it will be available for purchase in the [Letter Mingle Souls Etsy Store](http://www.etsy.com/shop/lettersminglesouls) and proceeds from its sale will also go toward April&#8217;s cancer care. I am really looking forward to buying my copy and trying all of the favorite Swap-bot recipes!
