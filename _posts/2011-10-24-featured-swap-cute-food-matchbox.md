I can&#8217;t resist cute food! So, even though I have featured quite a few matchbox swaps recently, I couldn&#8217;t pass up the [Cute Food Themed Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/102838) this week. Hosted by [PAStryloVER](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:PAStryloVER), the swap is **USA-only** and open to experienced users with a 4.9 rating, or higher. It is a simple, one-partner swap. 

Sign up by Saturday, and then send a cute, food-themed matchbox to your partner by November 12th. I&#8217;ve already signed up!
