Hello swappers! We just wanted to let everyone know that Swap-bot headquarters are (right now, as we speak) moving to New York City. Your friendly admin, Travis & Rachel (plus the site mascot, Crusher), are currently traveling across the country and will soon be settling in Brooklyn. Swap-bot email support may be a little delayed during the next two weeks, but we do plan to keep on working on site throughout the move. 

If you want to follow along on our adventure, check out Rachel&#8217;s personal website: [r. l. j. art](http://www.rljart.com/blog/). </ul>
