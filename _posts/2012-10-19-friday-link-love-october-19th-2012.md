It was another busy week here at Swap-bot HQ. My [sister-in-law ran her first full marathon](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/8097467930/in/photostream) in San Francisco and [Travis celebrated his 32nd birthday](http://www.rljart.com/blog/2012/10/19/32-sounds-like-a-good-number/). Fun times! 

I also managed to round up a bunch of high quality links this week&#8230; Enjoy!

**General fun stuff:**

  * The photo (above) makes it look so fun and delicious, I may need to make some of this [Birthday Cake Batter Bark](http://sweetapolita.com/2011/09/cake-batter-sprinkle-bark/#) for Travis this weekend&#8230;
  * Read this [awesome interview all about mail art](http://www.createmixedmedia.com/blogs/the-art-of-handwritten-letters-part-3) with Swap-bot user [MissThundercat](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MissThundercat).
