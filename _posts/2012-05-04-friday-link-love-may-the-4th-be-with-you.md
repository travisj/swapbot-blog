Lots of links this week:

  * For Star Wars Day: Check out the [round-up of Star Wars crafts on Craftzine](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2012/05/star_wars_craft_roundup_for_st.html), including the adorable [Chewbacca softie pattern from DrawPilgrim](http://www.drawpilgrim.com/2011/10/star-wars-softie-pattern-cuddly-chewbacca/). (Seen above to the left.)
  * For Cinco de Mayo: I will be extremely impressed if you make these very beautiful, very fun, but very complicated [Pinata Cookies](http://www.sheknows.com/food-and-recipes/articles/958083/cinco-de-mayo-pinata-cookies). (Seen above to the right.) They are sure to be a hit at any party, but man, they take a lot of steps to create!!
  * Or, if you are going to be watching the Kentucky Derby this weekend, why not make some [mint julep gelato](http://dabbled.org/2012/05/make-mint-julep-gelato-for-the-derby.html)?!
  * For more yum, make these [Mint Chocolate Chip Nutella Sandwich Cookies](http://www.munchkinmunchies.com/2012/03/mint-chocolate-chip-nutella-sandwich.html).
  * And your S&#8217;more of the week: [S&#8217;more Toffee](http://www.createdby-diane.com/2012/04/smore-toffee.html) from Created by Diane.
  * Get luxe DIY tutorials on the blog, [How Did You Make This](http://howdidyoumakethis.com/).
  * I like this very cool [neon necklace tutorial](http://www.cremedelacraft.com/2012/04/diy-neon-necklace-from-straws.html) on Creme de la Craft.
  * [What Does Making Things Mean?](http://www.craftypod.com/2012/05/04/free-podcast-what-does-making-things-mean-with-bridget-benton/) &#8211; the new free podcast from Sister Diane of CraftyPod. 
  * Why not join fellow postal mail enthusiast, Jessica of Miniature Rhino, in her [Month of Mail project](http://miniaturerhino.blogspot.com/2012/05/month-of-mail.html)?!
  * Flower arranging is a craft that seems to rise and fall in popularity. It must be on the rise now because Gwyneth Paltrow&#8217;s GOOP site just did this fairly extensive and very pretty [tutorial on arranging flowers by vase size](http://www.goop.com/newsletter/177/en). Lovely.
  * Oh noes&#8230; [zoo lions trying to eat babies](http://www.acedepartment.com/blog/2012/05/04/fun-friday-lions-eating-babies/)?!
  * If you are in NYC, come check out the [Spring Handmade Cavalcade](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/) in Brooklyn on Saturday. It is a local craft show with tons of great artists. (Plus, Swap-bot is a sponsor!)
  * Only one more day to get signed up for the [National Postcard Week Swap](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2012/05/03/featured-swap-national-postcard-week/)!
  * And one more Star Wars Day craft: [an ADORABLE mini Ewok from Wild Olive.](http://wildolive.blogspot.com/2012/05/may-4th-be-with-you.html) So cute! </ul> 
    **Have a fantastic weekend!**
