I have been [drinking a lot of juice lately](http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=4139), so I have citrus on the brain. There are lots of pretty lemon and lime colored creations on Etsy, like these cute rings by [CharmingRings](http://www.etsy.com/shop/CharmingRings). Check out these other refreshing handmade picks&#8230;
