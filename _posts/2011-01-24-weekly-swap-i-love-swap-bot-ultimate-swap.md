What could be better that a swap honoring the &#8216;bot? I say, nothing! If you are a fan of Swap-bot, you must check out [kheidedios&#8217;s](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kheidedios) swap: [I &hearts; Swap-bot Ultimate Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/82038).

For the swap, you make an ATC, a handmade postcard, and a matchbox for your one partner. All of your creations must incorporate Ernie the Envie (seen below). 

More info from the swap description: &#8220;Fill your matchbox with brads, buttons, ribbons, faux postages or other little embellishments. It may also be swap-bot themed or what you think your partner may use. Anything goes, but make sure you send something you would love to receive. For your postcards, you can do a collage, doodle or whatever. At the back, write why you love swap-bot and a tip on how you keep track of your swaps. Don&#8217;t forget to include your name, your swap-bot username, and your email address in your package.&#8221; Sign up before February 4th, and send before the 18th. 

If you need some inspiration, check out my [Flickr Gallery of Ernie Creations](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/galleries/72157622266549443/) and the [Ernie matchbox I made last year](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/3922886917/in/set-72157602135475903/).

**Bonus!! Everyone who sign up for this swap (and completes it) will get a pack of Ernie the Envie postcards in the mail straight from Swap-bot headquarters!!**
