The [Despicable Me Minion Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/64668) has concluded and many amazing Minion photos were submitted. The little Minions traveled all over the world! Everyone who submitted photos of their Minion was entered in a drawing for a big prize pack &#8211; a $50 Fandango gift certificate and fun movie merchandise &#8211; and a winner has finally been selected! In fact, Universal Pictures loved this swap so much that they decided to give away a second &#8220;runner up&#8221; prize of movie merchandise, as well!

The big winner is&#8230;
