_(I was out of town last week and could not keep up with the ol' Swap-bot blog. I hope you are not suffering from swap-of-the-week withdrawal!)_

For this week I have chosen to feature the [Ghost of Christmas letter swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/8981), hosted by [Chickpea](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=7973) <strong style="display:none"><a href="http://www.mettsalat.de/?the_game">The Game psp</a></strong> . I don't think I have ever featured a letter swap before and this one is quite creative.

For the swap you are assigned two partners, to whom you must send a letter detailing things you might see if you were visited by the three ghosts from [_A Christmas Carol_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol). The three things you must write about are as follows:

  * The past. Tell your partner about a past Christmas. Did you receive the Easy Bake Oven for which you were longing? Or did something sad, surprising, or magical happen?

</div>

  * The present. What are you doing this holiday season? Are you making an extra special gift for a friend or family member? What's going on now to make this holiday stand out?
  * The future. What would be your dream Christmas? Would it be a Mini Coop in the driveway or two tickets to Japan? Or would the dream Christmas mean that you wouldn't have to travel at all, and you could avoid the hustle and bustle of the airports and freeways?

What a nice way to share your Christmas memories and traditions and to learn about Christmases from all around the world! Your letters should be at least two pages long, and handwritten if possible. This is an **international** swap. You must have a **4.7** <u style="display:none">[Abilene Town buy](http://utero.pe/?abilene_town)</u> rating to participate. Newbies are welcome as long as they have a filled out profile.
