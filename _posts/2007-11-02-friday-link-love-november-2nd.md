      * Need to find a new hobby? (Probably not, if you are into swapping as much as me&#8230;) [Hobby Archive](http://www.hobbyarchive.com/) has information about all sorts of different hobbies. There are a lot of ads on the site, but you might find some helpful info.
      * If you are a ribbon collector, you must check out the <a href=http://www.ribbonjar.com/Default.asp">The Ribbon Jar</a>. The site sells a very wide variety of quality ribbon, but the special collection jars are the best.
      * Swap-bot is currently looking for advertisers who match our viewers&#8217; interests (to replace all those boring, generic Google ads). If you are interested, check out our [advertising info page](http://www.swap-bot.com/advertising.php) or email rachel [at] swap-bot.com.</ul>
