**More than 22,000 children are sleeping in New York City homeless shelters tonight.**

Even during more prosperous times, up to 1 in 5 New Yorkers are living in poverty. At this very difficult pandemic time, that number is only increasing. Everyone is facing challenges right now, but Swap-bot is still hoping to show our annual support for [The Partnership for the Homeless](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org). This is our 11th annual donation drive and we would love your help!

The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services, support, and advocacy for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate our donations. The money we collect will go toward the Partnership's general mission and may also provide rent assistance to a family in need to prevent future homelessness.

Our donation drive will run for all of December and we have two different giving options this year: 

1- You can donate via [PayPal to Swap-bot](https://www.paypal.me/swapbot). We will use your Paypal donations to make a direct donation to The Partnership for the Homeless.
2- OR send an email to rachel@swap-bot.com with the receipt of a donation you have made in Decemeber 2020 to another homeless assistance or food panty organization of your choice. This is a distinctly difficult time and we know that all local organizations need our support.

And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: Each Swap-bot member who sends in a donation of a gift card or item will earn the removal of one low (1 or 3) rating from their account!! You must make your donation by December 31st,2020. If you do not have a low rating on your account, you will receive a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only earn one rating removal credit during this donation drive. **Please include your Swap-bot username with your donation, however you choose to donate.**

The Fine Print: All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings — it is not a “free pass” for flaking. Everyone who donates will receive an email from me with the details of the rating removal credit. You can reply to that message any time to “cash in” your credit. I also make a permanent admin note (only visible to admin) on each donor’s account stating that they have a rating removal credit.

As always, let me know if you have any questions.
