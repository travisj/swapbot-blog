**Hello!** Yesterday was the [Etsy Craft Party](http://www.etsy.com/craft-party). I went to the Brooklyn event hosted near Etsy HQ in DUMBO, Brooklyn. The party was hosted in an old warehouse under the Brooklyn Bridge &#8212; very cool! Each attendee got to stitch a cute hand puppet to keep or donate to a local children's charity. The weather was beautiful and there were hundreds of attendees. Fun! **Did you attend a Craft Party in your area?**
