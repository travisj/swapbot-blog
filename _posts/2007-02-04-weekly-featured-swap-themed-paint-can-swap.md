<img id="image42" class="alignleft" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/swap.jpg" alt="swap.jpg" />This week we are featuring the [Themed Paint Can Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2088) coordinated by [fairykiss](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=3548). Each swapper only has one partner for this unique swap, which is a good idea because of the creativity and time needed to create a themed paint can. A themed or altered paint can is simply a new, clean, one-gallon paint can that has been decorated and filled according to a specific theme. Check out these [instructions](http://www.scrapjazz.com/topics/Techniques/Altered_Art/512.php) for step by step directions on how to make one. 

The [Themed Paint Can Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2088) is open until February 17th for signup. Participants then have over a month to check out their partner&#8217;s profile and decorate and fill a lovely paint can that matches their personality. There is a $10 **minimum** for the things you put inside the paint can. This swap is US only.

Or, if your partner likes scrapbooking, a paint can filled with fun scrapbooking embellishments and tools would be sure to please! A single favorite color, or two, could also be interpreted as a theme. 

This fun swap really gets your imagination going! It is perfect for swappers who would like to put a little extra care in creating a beautiful swap package. Have fun!
