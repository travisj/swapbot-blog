There is still time to donate to the holiday gift donation drive to benefit [The Partnership for the Homeless](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5)!

So far, the Swap-bot community has donated more than $700 in gift cards and gift items to be distributed at the Children&#8217;s Holiday Party on December 14th. Can we get to $1000?!

[**Read all of the details about the donation drive here.**](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2013/11/12/2013-holiday-gift-donation-drive/)

Donate by this Friday, December 6th, and earn one rating removal credit. You can mail in gift cards or toys, or use the button below to donate directly via Paypal:

**The Donation Drive is now closed. Thank you all for participating!**
