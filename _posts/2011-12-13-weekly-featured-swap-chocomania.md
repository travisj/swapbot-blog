f you are a chocoholic like me, you might want to join the [Chocomania Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/108060) hosted by [BeeGon](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:BeeGon). For the swap you only have one partner, but you send them three different chocolate bars:

  1. One milk chocolate. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk.
  2. One white chocolate. White chocolate is formed from a mixture of sugar, cocoa butter and milk solids. Although its texture is similar to milk and dark chocolate, it does not contain any cocoa solids.
  3. And finally, one dark chocolate. Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture.

Anyone with a 4.7 rating, or higher, is welcome to join this **international** swap. [Sign up before January 8th!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/108060)
