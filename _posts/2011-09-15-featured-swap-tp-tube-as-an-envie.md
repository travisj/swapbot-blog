I have been saving my toilet paper tubes for months and have wanted to use them in a mail craft &#8212; now is my chance!! Join me in the [TP Tube as an Envie Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/100701). The swap is hosted by [nlgrudis](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:nlgrudis) and this iteration is an Autumn theme. Here are the directions:

_&#8220;Get an Empty TP Tube (the center tube the paper is wrapped around). Cut two circles of cardboard or cardstock to cover the ends. Tape one end closed. Now stuff the tube with goodies. Fill with Autumn or Fall themed items……</p> 

  * photos, photo magnet frames, SD cards or holders, photo mounting corners, postage stamps, etc.
  * Crafting how to DIY (templates, directions, etc.)
  * Brads, eyelets, ribbon, Glue dots, Scrapbook paper and/or stickers can be rolled to fit in the tube.
  * Small sewing notions (seam rippers, buttons, thread, etc.)
  * Small hard candies or gum
  * Tealite candles
  * Key chains
  * Tea bags, Single serve hot chocolate, coffee, drink mixes (kind you add to bottled water)
  * Recipes or cooking
  * Jewelry or jewelry making supplies
  * Mini markers, pencils, pens
  * Postage stamps, bookmarks or other stationary items
  * Small paper punches or stamps or other small embellishments
  * Something handmade

The possibilities are endless! Be creative, challenge yourself & have a blast!&#8221;</i>
