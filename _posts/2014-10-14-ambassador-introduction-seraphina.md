They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [seraphina](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:seraphina)!** Seraphina lives in Kaousiung, Taiwan, where there are 300 days of sunshine per year! She has been a member of Swap-bot since 2012. She loves tea, stationery, strawberries, and paper crafting. 

**Ambassador Region:** Taiwan

**How seraphina found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I found swap-bot is because one of my friend introduce me about swap-bot, she’s also the member.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;Besides learning English, I like to exchange stuff with other countries, to learn their culture, foods, life style, stamps, writing, special wrapping, etc.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;I love food swaps, used stamps swaps, stationery swaps, and seasonal swaps.&#8221; 

**Check out one of seraphina&#8217;s food swap packages:**

**Interesting fact about seraphina:** &#8220;I always forgot my key still IN my motorcycle’s keyhold and go away, or leave it IN motorcycle’s seat after I locked the seat&#8230; I should say I’m lucky no one steals it until I back, and my brother always takes an extra key with him just in case. (Yes, he helps me out of most trouble! hahaha.)&#8221;

_I hope you are enjoying getting to know your fellow swappers with these Ambassador introductions. If you are interested in swapping paper crafts, stamps, stationery, or for Taiwanese ephemera or food, [seraphina](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:seraphina) is definitely the member to contact._
