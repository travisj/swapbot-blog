For today, the first day of spring, I am trying to put a little pep in my step. I think these links will help:

  * Lovely inspiration in the [Best of Spring Flickr pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/best_of_spring/).
  * [Kindred](http://www.thekindredsite.com/) is a new website from the creators of [decor8](http://decor8blog.com/) and [Creature Comforts](http://creaturecomforts.typepad.com/) which features free downloads of beautiful desktop wallpapers and printable greeting cards. Really gorgeous stuff going on over there!
  * [Red Velvet Art](http://www.redvelvetart.com/) is a wacky, new online store from designer [Elsie Flannigan](http://abeautifulmess.typepad.com/). Elsie used to design the [Love, Elsie](http://www.loveelsie.com/) scrapbooking line for KI Memories and I really loved its doodle-y style. Red Velvet Art is maybe just a tad over-the-top in the hipster department, but still tons of fun!
  * Speaking of hipsters, [Something&#8217;s Hiding In Here](http://somethingshidinginhere.typepad.com/) is a too-cool blog from designers, Shauna and Stephen. The pair&#8217;s loft apartment was recently featured on [Etsy&#8217;s &#8220;Get The Look: Home Decor Edition&#8221;](http://www.etsy.com/storque/spotlight/etsy-finds-decor-playful-loft-living-with-somethings-hiding--3615/) and on the [&#8220;There&#8217;s No Place Like Here&#8221; video series](http://www.etsy.com/storque/spotlight/theres-no-place-like-here-somethings-hiding-in-here-3439/).
  * Not-so-good news: The US Postal Service is increasing their rates on May 11th. [Go here for the complete new price list.](http://www.usps.com/prices/pricechanges.htm)
