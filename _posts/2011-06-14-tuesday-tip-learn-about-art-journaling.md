Do you keep a journal or diary? How about a visual diary or altered journal? Art journaling is an art form that incorporates writing, drawing, painting, collage, and scrapbooking within a bound book of some type. It is a way of expressing yourself freely and experimenting with different techniques. You can find some amazing examples of art journaling on [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/search/?q=art+journal) and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%22art%20journal%22).

User [spinjenny](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:spinjenny) (whose journal pages are seen above) describes visual journaling like this: 

_Looking at other people&#8217;s pages shows what a wide range of journals people keep. For some people, it is a diary, a notebook, a record of their experiments, a resource for later reference, or somewhere to let out their deepest feelings. Some are really sketchbooks with a few more words than usual. Some are mainly words with some decoration &#8211; painted backgrounds, doodles, cartoons or more realistic sketches. Some are multi-layered mixed media art. Anything goes! There are no rights or wrongs in journalling, just what works best for you. I&#8217;m still in the experimenting stage &#8211; looking at a lot of other people&#8217;s work, and trying out styles and materials._ 

The [topic of art journaling](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/77118/1) was recently brought up in the Swap-bot forums by [mrsdutton](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mrsdutton) and many helpful users responded with some great tips and links.
