Halloween Matchboxes are one of my very favorite swap themes! I do at least one every year. (Above is a matchbox I recently made. The drawer is pulled open a bit and the content is arranged around it.)

If you&#8217;d like to make a Halloween matchbox this year, there is still time! Join the [Happy Halloween Art Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/102955) hosted by [Soleil](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Soleil). The sign up deadline for the **international** swap is October 20th. It has a very quick turn around &#8211; the mail deadline is the 25th. The swap is open to everyone, even new users, but questionable swappers will be removed. [Sign up now!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/102955)

Can&#8217;t wait to see all of the creepy craft creations!!
