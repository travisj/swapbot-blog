The deadline for donating to the [Swap-bot Winter Donation Drive](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/11/29/donation-drive-for-the-partnership-for-the-homeless/) to benefit [The Partnership for the Homeless](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5) has now passed&#8230; but let me tell you, I am so incredibly impressed with the response to this program! I am still going through some of the last packages to get the final count (and waiting on just a few more from those who&#8217;ve contacted me), but we received donations from approximately 100 Swap-bot members!! I haven&#8217;t made a final count of all the items donated, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we have over 300 hats, gloves, and scarves. Amazing!

**Thank you to everyone who donated!**

Here is the most recent photo of the donation packages I picked up at our mailbox:

I am taking all of our donations to The Partnership for the Homeless offices on Friday. I will take photos of the huge pile of winter gear before I go and post another update once everything has been dropped off. This donation drive has exceeded my expectations and I hope that we can make it an annual event. xoxo
