Last week I traveled to Portland, Oregon, to visit my brother and sister-in-law. In between trying out all of the delicious food Portland has to offer, I managed to do a little shopping and I was thrilled to run into the downtown location of the brick and mortar [Crafty Wonderland](http://craftywonderland.com) boutique.

Years ago, when we lived in Eugene, I would travel up to Portland nearly every month to go to the Crafty Wonderland craft markets. Then, they were only once a month and were held at the Doug Fir Lounge in East Portland. In 2007, I even [conducted some of my research](http://www.rljart.com/blog/2007/03/11/back-from-portland-again/) for my master's degree project at Crafty Wonderland. I passed out questionnaires to the vendors and they were all very kind and helpful. So, as you can see, Crafty Wonderland holds a special place in my heart.

I was really excited to check out the cool store full of handmade goodies. The featured artists for June were the art duo, [Jolby & Friends](http://craftywonderland.com/2013/06/june-artist-of-the-month-jolby/). I love how the featured artists get their own special place within the store.

There were all sorts of great locally made items in the store &#8212; stationery, postcards, jewelry, clothing, drink ware, art, toys, etc. I was drawn to all of the fun felt items, like these cute [pincushions](http://www.etsy.com/shop/buttonarcade?section_id=5003216) (above) and [brooches](http://www.etsy.com/shop/buttonarcade?section_id=11044681) (below) from [Button Arcade](http://www.etsy.com/shop/buttonarcade). I really wanted to get a set of [these ceramic coasters](http://www.etsy.com/listing/77411463/visit-portland-oregon-tile-coaster?ref=sr_gallery_14&ga_search_query=portland+ceramic+tile+coasters&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_ship_to=US&ga_search_type=all) from Robot Candy, but held back. Maybe on my next trip&#8230;

If you are in Portland, I definitely recommend visiting [Crafty Wonderland](http://craftywonderland.com) for unique gifts and souvenirs. I know you will find something you love!
