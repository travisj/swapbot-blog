Ok. You caught me. I missed last week&#8217;s featured swap&#8230; sorry. We are back in action this week with a fun featured swap: [Make Me Smile](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3029). The swap is all about making yourself and your partners happy! It is coordinated by [lindalinda](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=6587) and it is open for sign up through April 30th. It is an international swap with three partners and three parts. Following is the swap&#8217;s description of the three things you send to each partner: 

  1. Put together a mix cd of about 15-20 tracks that make you smile. Might include sugary-sweet 50s pop, anything with smile-worthy lyrics, songs that bring back happy memories, a recording of a favorite comedian, maybe even a silly song you listened to as a child. Whatever works for you. Please don&#8217;t include more than 2 songs by a single artist. Be sure to include a track listing sheet. You might even want to write descriptions about why some of the songs you chose make you happy.
  2. Make a list of 100 things that make you happy. I did this a long time ago in a writing class, and it was a real challenge, but fun and worth the effort.
  3. Include a little inexpensive surprise in the envelope that you think will make your partner smile. Could be something handmade, could be candy, could be a cute little notepad, a pen, glittery stickers, whatever.

Making the list of 100 things that make you happy will be tough, but fun! I am pumped to try, anyway. How fun will it be to get three mix cds of music that is bound to make you smile?! I can&#8217;t wait!
