Here is Sugarbug’s answer to the question, **What is pictured in your most cherished family photograph?** :

Sugarbug on 07 Dec 2008: &#8220;I have so many, but one of my favorites is of my son and me moments after he was placed on my chest.&#8221;

Thanks to everyone who entered the drawing. I loved reading all of the comments about your cherished photos. There will be another giveaway announced at the beginning of January, so check back.
