Hi. We are experiencing problems in sending our automated Swap-bot emails to AOL email addresses. This means that new users are having trouble verifying their email addresses and current members are no longer getting our reminders and notifications. We are looking into the problem, but for now we suggest using a non-AOL email address for Swap-bot accounts. [Yahoo](http://login.yahoo.com/config/login?logout=1&.done=http://mail.yahoo.com&.src=ym&.intl=us) and [Gmail](https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=mail&passive=true&rm=false&continue=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F%3Fui%3Dhtml%26zy%3Dl&ltmpl=postaf_ca_tlsosm_t&ltmplcache=2) offer free email accounts. We are very sorry for this inconvenience and hope to have the problem fixed as soon as possible!

Also, I am sorry about the delay in email responses today and yesterday. A big research paper deadline and an out-of-town webmaster made life a little bit hectic! xoxo
