They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [TheWhiteSquirrel](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TheWhiteSquirrel)!** TheWhiteSquirrel lives in &#8220;The Deep Freeze&#8221; aka Fargo, North Dakota. She loves mail art, stationery, and all things Air Mail-themed&#8230; and squirrels, of course! She has been swapping on the &#8216;bot for well over a year and has nearly five hundred 5 ratings!

**Ambassador Region:** North Dakota, USA

**How TheWhiteSquirrel found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I truly just stumbled upon it while searching online for some sort of pen pal site one day (and SO happy I did).&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I adore Swap-bot&#8230;.Mail gives me a chance to travel and open my world to learn new things from the comfort of my own home. I get to meet such wonderful people who, despite our differences, all share a common interest &#8212; Post! It&#8217;s such an inspiration and an outlet for creativity that gives us all a chance to lift ones spirits. Each new swap I sign up for is a new challenge that keeps me going. There are days when I simply don&#8217;t know what I would do without these connections &#8212; I just love it so.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;Type 3! Thought, care & a little effort goes a long way with me. I really enjoy swapping Mail Art &#8212; it&#8217;s my favorite. I love to see other people&#8217;s creations and read their stories. (I imagine what their life is like and step into their world for a brief moment.) I also trade tea often, chocolate from time to time, coins/currency, and am thrilled with anything Air Mail related or anything covered in postage stamps!&#8221;

**Interesting facts about TheWhiteSquirrel:** 

  * &#8220;I&#8217;ve been to 3 continents and 5 countries.&#8221;
  * &#8220;I like to eat pickles out of tea cups and drink just about everything out of a stein.&#8221;
  * &#8220;Oh! &#8212; and did I mention I <3 Squirrels?"
