This week we are featuring a very unique and clever swap hosted by [spoonergregory](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=7606) <strong style="display:none"><a href="http://www.barryshamis.com/?banshee_">Banshee!!! psp</a></strong> called [Art from Start to Finish](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6020). This extremely creative international swap is open to experienced participants who have over a 4.5 rating. The purpose of the swap is to &#8220;find out about the process that other people go through when they make a piece of original artwork.&#8221; For the swap you create one original piece of artwork (any medium except photography or ATCs) and document the entire process. Each participant will send their one partner the following items:

  * The piece of original artwork created for this swap.</a> 
      * A letter explaining your creative process. This can be t <div style="display: none">
          <a href="http://capturehislove.com/" title="relationship advice">relationship advice</a>
        </div>
        
        yped or handwritten, but must be at least two pages.</li> 
        
          * A photograph of the materials you used.
          * A photograph of your work space.
          * At least three photographs of the work at various stages of completion.
          * Your early sketches/photographs/ideas that you used as inspiration for the finished piece</ul> 
        
        As you can see, this is a very involved swap, but it would be absolutely fascinating to get an inside look into other artists' creative processes and to show off your own work! [Art from Start to Finish](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6020) is open for sign up through the 30th of August. After that you have a full month (until October 1st) to create and document your art. Please see the [swap's info page](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6020) for the complete requirements. Good luck and happy swapping!
