How is your holiday shopping going? Want to help support independent artists while picking out super-unique gifts for your friends and family? Well, if you are in the New York City area, you are in luck! The [Etsy NY Holiday Handmade Cavalcade](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com) is happening this week! 

Let the Etsy NY Team help you find the perfect gift for everyone on your holiday list! More than 50 local indie vendors will be on hand with a selection of handmade wares including jewelry, stationery, art, beauty products, clothing, and more. The Holiday Handmade Cavalcade has nine years worth of history, and has become a must for holiday shoppers looking for unique and locally crafted gifts for their loved ones. Swap-bot has been a sponsor of the event for many of those years, including in [2010](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/12/07/holiday-handmade-cavalcade/) and [2012](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2012/11/26/holiday-handmade-cavalcade-2012/), and we are once again a [sponsor](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/sponsors/) this year!

The 2016 Holiday Handmade Cavalcade will be held at Chelsea Market (410 West 16th Street) in Manhattan from Monday, December 5th, through Sunday, December 11th. There is a special [“Sip n Shop” event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2016-holiday-handmade-cavalcade-and-sip-n-shop-special-event-tickets-28664817240) at 6:30 on Thursday evening sponsored by Brooklyn Brewery. On Saturday and Sunday, the first 100 shoppers will receive goody bags packed with goodies, including some Swap-bot stuff! 

I plan to do my shopping at the Holiday Handmade Cavalcade on Thursday night… see you there??
