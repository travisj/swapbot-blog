We just released some great new features for Swap-bot!

You can now send Messages to all of your buddies and swap partners via the Swap-bot web messaging system. Now, when you contact other members a message is sent to their inbox on Swap-bot.com. After logging in, you can check your messages by clicking on the link at the top of the Swap-bot page.

In order to cut down on bad swappers signing up for swaps at the last minute (when it is too late for coordinators to ban them), we have made it so that every coordinator has a chance to check over the final list of swap participants before partners are assigned. It is now the coordinators&#8217; responsibility to initiate the partner assignment process. See [question 17 of the FAQs](http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php#question17) for more info.

You might have also noticed that the Swap-bot Blog got a little face-lift. We are planning on updating this blog MUCH more often about changes and updates to swap-bot. I am also going to start featuring a cool swap every week on the blog. Look for the &#8220;Weekly Featured Swap&#8221; to be posted every Sunday.

We hope you like the new features! Please keep us posted about things you would like to see on Swap-bot. We love to hear your feedback!<u style="display:none">[City of Joy buy](http://utero.pe/?city_of_joy)</u>
