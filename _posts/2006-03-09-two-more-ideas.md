Two more ideas via email:

  * Show the parters that sent (or should have sent) to you after one month (at the same time the &#8220;nag&#8221; emails stop)
  * Once you click &#8220;I sent my items&#8221;, the swap gets moved to the &#8220;Previous Swaps&#8221; section

Both great ideas and unless someone tells me otherwise, I am going to get to them sometime soon. Thanks Robyn.
