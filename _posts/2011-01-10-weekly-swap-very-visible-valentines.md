It is that time of year&#8230; whether you hate Valentine&#8217;s Day or love it, it will be here soon! And this week I chose a unique valentine swap to feature: [Very Visible Valentines](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/79880) hosted by [Corazon](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Corazon). The aim of the swap is for each participant to send valentines through the mail that all viewers can enjoy. From the swap description: 

_Don&#8217;t hide your Valentine&#8217;s Day emotions in a plain white envelope, let the love show! This is your chance to share Valentine&#8217;s Day with your mail carrier, post office, your partner&#8217;s mail carrier as well as your partner!</p> 

Make a Valentine&#8217;s Day postcard or decorate an envelope in a Valentine&#8217;s Day theme. Here are some thoughts: 

  * heart shaped card
  * sequins/jewels
  * beads
  * glitzy sewing trim
  * fun color combos such as pink/purple or black/red/silver
  * old Valentine pictures or quotes
  * fun magazine pictures

You will be making 2 Valentines, sending 1 to each of 2 partners. You will have 3 weeks after the last sign up day to make your cards, so please make something you would be proud to receive. Have fun and make sure you leave a Valentine&#8217;s Day message for your partner so he/she knows who you are to rate you!</i>

Any swapper with over a 4.8 rating is welcome to join, but sign up fast! The sign up deadline is this Friday, the 14th. Whether you in love with the holiday or not, this is your chance to make and receive some unique Valentine&#8217;s greetings!
