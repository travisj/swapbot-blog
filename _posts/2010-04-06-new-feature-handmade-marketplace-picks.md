Swap-bot loves ! There is just so much inspiration to be found by browsing through beautiful hand-crafted creations! So, as a new feature, I will be posting some of my favorite Etsy finds each week here, on the Swap-bot blog. The picks will probably follow a theme each time, and I would love to hear your suggestions of sellers or items that you think should be included. 

This week, check out all of these snail mail themed items:
