Your fun Friday links fall into two of my favorite categories this week: Sweets and Snail Mail! Have fun!

**Sweets:**

  * I want the cookies pictured above right now: [Gooey Chocolate Chip Sandwich Cookies](http://www.recipegirl.com/2011/09/29/gooey-chocolate-chip-sandwich-bars-cookies-for-kids-cancer-cookbook/).
  * A taste of fall, [Pumpkin Whoopie Pies](http://www.creaturecomfortsblog.com/home/2011/9/29/pumpkin-whoopie-pies-two-ways-a-free-printable.html). (Plus a free printable cupcake topper!)
  * Kids would love these [crazy, colorful, Halloween Rice Krispie Treats](http://choosetothrive.blogspot.com/2011/09/crazy-halloween-rice-crispy-treats.html).
  * Learn [how to make chocolates](http://www.etsy.com/blog/en/2011/how-to-make-chocolates/) on the Etsy blog.
