<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.swap-bot.com/images/swaps/2107/swap.jpg" />Matchbox swaps have been quite popular lately, and this week&#8217;s featured swap is th [SpringTime Kawaii Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2107) coordinated by [Straycat](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4510). 

Kawaii is a certain style of cute products from Japan. And when I say cute, I mean CUTE! Check out the description of [Kawaii on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii), or visit the [Japan Cute! blog](http://community.livejournal.com/japancute/) <u style="display:none">[Sideways film](http://utero.pe/?sideways)</u> to learn more about it. There have been previous swaps on swap-bot based around Kawaii, including previous [Kawaii matchbox swaps](http://www.flickr.com/groups/kawaiimatchboxswap/). A matchbox swap basically entails decorating a small matchbox and filling it full of little trinkets and goodies.

> Simply load up a decorated matchbox with tiny kawaii items & mail it to your partner! At least 1 store-bought Japanese kawaii item must be included. Handmade goods are optional & adored! Please try to jam pack the little matchbox as much as possible. Springtime: Let&#8217;s welcome the new season with pretty colors & cute animals! Kawaii: It means &#8220;cute&#8221; in Japanese. ie Sanrio, Q-Lia, Kamio, Lemon Co., Midori, etc. Matchbox: A cutely decorated 32-stick or a Euro matchbox is our goal, but&#8230; hehe If it&#8217;s cute & tiny, it&#8217;s accepted! DIY, tiny candy boxes, or other purchased equivalents are a-okay.

The Springtime Kawaii Matchbox Swap is international, but it does require a 4.0 rating or higher. Matchbox swaps are a great way to express your creativity without spending a ton on supplies and postage! Happy swapping!
