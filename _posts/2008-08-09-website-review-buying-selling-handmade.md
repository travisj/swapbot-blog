We all know about the online auction giant [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/), and almost everyone is loving [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/) for buying and selling handmade goods online, but what if you want an alternative option for finding cool, independent artists and crafters or selling your own crafts? I have discovered three more websites where you can buy or sell handmade items: [Lov.li](http://www.lov.li./), [DaWanda](http://en.dawanda.com/), and [Made It](http://www.madeit.com.au/).

**Lov.li**

[Lov.li](http://www.lov.li./) is a community of people who love art, crafts and handmade products. On the site you can buy cool stuff, share your art, sell your products, create groups, promote events, share video, and of course, make friends. People from all over the world use the site to sell their handmade crafts and to interact with other artists and crafters. You can create your own blog on the site and join groups based around specific crafting interests. Jewelry and accessories seem to be the most popular items being sold on Lov.li, but there is a wide variety of items to explore. Although the site seems somewhat simple, there are many interesting ways to search for products, including by maker, tag, and by those being made closest to your own location.

**DaWanda: Products with Love**

From the [DaWanda](http://en.dawanda.com/) site: &#8220;DaWanda is about people and their products: it is a place where you can discover original and quality products as well as the people who have a passion to create and to share their creations and where you can contribute by sharing your ideas and what you like and by giving inspiration.&#8221; DaWanda is based in Europe and the site can be viewed in English, French, or German. Independent artists and craft people sell truly awesome fashions, home products, and supplies on the site. The products being sold on DaWands seem to have an especially high level of quality and uniqueness and the site seems clear and easy to navigate. The site also includes discussion forums in all three languages that anyone can participate in, even if you are not selling or buying.

**Made It: buy, sell, and talk independent**

[Made It](http://www.madeit.com.au/) is an Australian shop and directory of independent designers. Selling is restricted to Australian residents, but buyers from overseas are welcomed. Everything from stationery to bath and body products to clothing is sold on Made It. Made It also has discussion forums, but the highlight of the site is the comprehensive [independent Australian designer directory](http://www.madeit.com.au/directory/directory.html) which profiles hundreds of indie businesses.
