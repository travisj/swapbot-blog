I studied painting in college and to this day I&#8217;m still always looking for beautiful paintings. My favorites usually incorporate bright colors and thick paint. I gravitate toward very simple still lifes, because they often allow the actual paint to become the star of the painting [Develop The Ultimate Minset For Success](http://stagchipcarog1987.devhub.com/blog/1442514-develop-the-ultimate-minset-for-success/ "Develop The Ultimate Minset For Success") instead of the subject matter. These are some of my favorite painting picks from Etsy.com&#8230;
