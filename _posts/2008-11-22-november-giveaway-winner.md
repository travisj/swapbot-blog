will make them smile. HeideC&#8221;

We did the drawing a little bit differently this month since there were so many participants. We basically took out any duplicate comments by the same person, added people who had emailed me, and then used a random number generator on the computer to pick the winner. Not exactly as fun as making Travis draw from a bucket, but still totally random. Cool. Thanks for playing! We have more drawings coming up soon.
