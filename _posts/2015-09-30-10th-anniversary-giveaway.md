Hello snail mail lovers! We have big news&#8230; **October will mark Swap-bot&#8217;s 10th Anniversary!** Wow. 10 years of postcards, letters, crafts, gifts, art, and lots more traveling all over the world. We hope this decade of snail mail swaps has helped make the world a slightly more friendly and fun place.

Our impending anniversary inspired me to create a few new Swap-bot postcards and some other fun swag. And I want to get it out into the world&#8230;
