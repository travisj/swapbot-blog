This week we are featuring the [Paper Postcard Quilt swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/23485) hosted by [FloridaGirl](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:FloridaGirl) . This swap is international with two partners assigned to each swapper. The sign up deadline is October 31st, and you must send by November 21st, 2008. This allows plenty of time to create beautiful paper quilts for your partners.

From the swap description:

> The idea for this swap is for paper crafts as well as quilters to make a postcard quilt.You will make 2 postcards one for each of your partners. The postcards are:
> 
> Size is 4&#8243; x 6&#8243;.
> 
> The foundation and patchwork have to be out of paper
> 
> You may add embellishments such as ribbon, buttons, beads &#8211; but there are to be no stickers.
> 
> Senders choice to give you more artistic freedom.
> 
> Put the card together so it will stay together.
> 
> Send each one in an envelope to be safe.
> 
> Send only ones you are proud of.
> 
> This swap is International and open to newbies that have completed 1 mail swap. No one with a rating less than 4.7 may participate.

Happy swapping!

_\*\\*\* We plan to feature a new, unique, public swap each week here on the Swap-bot blog. If you would like to have your swap featured, or have a suggestion for a weekly featured swap, please let me know at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. The swaps must have some sort of creative aspect (not just purchasing items), they must be public, and the coordinator must be in good standing on Swap-bot. The more unique and creative, the better! \*\**_
