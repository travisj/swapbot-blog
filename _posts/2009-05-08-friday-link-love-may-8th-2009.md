There has been lot of good stuff to see out in the crafty interwebs this week! Here is a random selection of general craft fun and some Mother&#8217;s Day stuff for your clicking enjoyment:

  * First and foremost, that adorable [Ernie the envie stuffie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/36587412@N03/3430276938/in/set-72157616097293357/) you see above was created by Swap-bot user, [KawaiiFiend](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kawaiifiend). What an amazingly accurate and realistic portrait of Ernie in felt &#8211; and super-cute to boot!! Love it. 
  * For Mother&#8217;s Day: [Mother&#8217;s Day corsage tutorial on Craft:zine](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2009/05/how-to_tuesdays_mothers_day_co.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954), [Mother&#8217;s Day craft ideas for kids on Woman&#8217;s Day](http://www.womansday.com/Articles/Crafts/Heart-Felt-Mother-s-Day-Crafts-for-Kids.html), [Mother&#8217;s Day craft projects from the world of Martha Stewart](http://thecraftsdept.marthastewart.com/2009/05/mothers-day-crafts.html), and finally, a very pretty [free Mother&#8217;s Day door hanger download from Twig & Thistle](http://www.twigandthistle.com/blog/2009/05/diy-mothers-day-door-hanger/).
  * These cute pincushions could also make a quick and cute Mother&#8217;s Day gift: [Free Bitty Bug pincushion tutorial from goody-goody](http://goodygoody.typepad.com/goody_goody/2009/05/bitty-bug-pincushion.html).
  * Speaking of free &#8211; and of something you could use for Mother&#8217;s Day &#8211; [Creature Comforts has some lovely, simple cupcake tags free for download](http://creaturecomforts.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/05/two-favorite-things-a-freebie.html) .
  * I am loving Ali Edwards&#8217; words of wisdom on [how to work through creative fear](http://aliedwards.typepad.com/_a_/2009/05/working-through-creative-fear.html). Inspiring!
  * Ok, I have posted about this site before, but lately it has been cracking me up more and more: [Craftastrophe](http://craftastrophe.net/). The site writers, Sam and Karen, post about really odd handmade items that they find all over the internet. Sometimes I feel really bad reading the site and laughing at another person&#8217;s hard work and creativity&#8230; but there are some crafts out there that are extremely bizarre!! &#8230; and funny.
  * New York swappers: I am planning on attending [Monday night&#8217;s (5/11) Etsy Labs event](http://www.etsy.com/storque/events/news-from-the-etsy-labs-511-cupcake-craft-night-3920/) in Brooklyn. It is from 5 &#8211; 8 pm and it is going to be all about cupcakes! I had a lot of fun at the [last Etsy Labs I attended](http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=1985), so I would definitely recommend it. Make sure to let me know if you are going to be there and I will bring you some Swap-bot goodies. (Email me rachel [at] swap-bot.com.)

Have a great spring weekend, everyone! xoxo
