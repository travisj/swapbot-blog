Look at this adorable Swap-bot envelope stuffie! It was made by Swap-bot user [Provadia](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:provadia) to send to [stampkrl](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:stampkrl). I think it is the coolest thing ever! 

BTW: The Swap-bot envelope was named over the weekend &#8211; his name is now Ernie the envie. User, [VJP](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:VJP), gave the suggestion and I think the name fits perfectly! Now he just needs a little buddy&#8230; Polly the package, maybe?
