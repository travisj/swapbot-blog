The weather is beautiful in my neck of the woods today &#8212; spring is on its way and that puts everyone in a good mood! I found a bunch of fun links this week, but feel free to add more in the comments&#8230;

  * Today, many people in the blogosphere are participating in [For Japan With Love](http://www.forjapanwithlove.com/), a fundraiser for disaster relief in Japan. And, [Craftzine.com has a bunch of craft-related Japan relief links, too](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2011/03/crafters_come_together_for_jap.html). 
  * Spring craft: Turn pom poms, twigs and a few craft supplies into an adorable Pom Pom tree with this [tutorial from Dollar Store Crafts](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2011/03/make-a-miniature-pom-pom-tree/).
  * Another Spring Craft: [no-sew fabric and wire flower tutorial from Between the Lines](http://pm-betweenthelines.blogspot.com/2011/03/fabric-and-wire-flowers-tutorial.html).
  * For matchbox lovers, these [Instant Comfort Pocket Boxes by Kim Welling](http://kimwelling.blogspot.com/2011/03/instant-comfort-pocket-box.html) will inspire you.
  * Wow!! I love this [Moroccan-style painted wallpaper tutorial on Jones Design Company](http://jonesdesigncompany.com/decorate/painted-wallpaper-a-tutorial/). So classy!
  * These [printable paper cameras from the Mel Stringer Etsy shop](http://www.etsy.com/shop/girliepains?section_id=7795714) are so aborable!
  * Having a party anytime soon? These [confetti popper invitations from Oh Happy Day](http://jordanferney.blogspot.com/2011/03/confetti-invitations-template.html) would surely be a hit. 
      * This is actually from the holiday season, but I love these [beautiful gift wrapping ideas from Grey likes Weddings](http://www.greylikesweddings.com/3-resources/diy-gift-wrap-ed-02/). Sequins trim as ribbon &#8211; genius!
      * Babble.com recently announced their picks for the [Top 50 Mom Craft Blogs](http://www.babble.com/mom/beauty-style/top-50-craft-mom-blogs-2011-best-overall/) &#8211; Did your favorite make the list?</ul> 
    Have a great weekend!
