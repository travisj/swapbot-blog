Since learning about the [passing of 104-year-old NYC heiress Huguette Clark](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/nyregion/huguette-clark-recluse-heiress-dies-at-104.html?_r=1) on Tuesday, I have been fascinated by the [story of her life](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38810137/ns/business-huguette_clark_mystery/). (That is her on the right with her sister and father in 1917.) She is the last surviving heir of a gilded age copper baron and she left a fortune of billions with no descendants. She lived as a recluse and loved collecting dolls. She had three mansions, but hadn&#8217;t visited two of them in decades. So intriguing!! 

Inspired by Huguette&#8217;s strange and incredible life, I picked some gilded-age-style vintage and handmade items from Etsy that I think she may have liked&#8230;

Did you hear about Huguette&#8217;s passing? Were you as intrigued as I was about her one-of-a-kind life?
