[Angry Chicken](http://angrychicken.typepad.com/angry_chicken/) is one of the most popular and well-known crafty blogs. It is written by Amy Karol in Portland, Oregon. Amy wrote the book, [Bend-the-Rules Sewing](http://www.amykarol.com/) , runs a [mailorder craft activity club](http://www.kingpod.com/?page=mailorder8.html), and makes [textile art](http://www.kingpod.com/). Angry Chicken is the place where she shows off her crafty creations and shares her personal musings. Amy is an amazing seamstress and she is always sharing her inspiring projects. In addition to Angry Chicken, she also hosts an apron blog called [Tie One On](http://angrychicken.typepad.com/tieoneon/). If you love to sew, both blogs are must reads!
