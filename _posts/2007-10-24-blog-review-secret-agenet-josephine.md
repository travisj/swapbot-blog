I just found Brenda&#8217;s [Secret Agent Josephine blog](http://www.secret-agent-josephine.com/blog/) 

<div style="display:none">

</div>

via the [Inspiration Boards blog](http://inspirationboards.blogspot.com/) via the [Craft:blog](http://www.craftzine.com/blog/archive/2007/10/inspiration_boards_blog.html). I have obviously only been reading it for the last few days, but the adorable graphics and funny stories really sucked me in. Brenda is a graphic designer and a mom of one Babybug. She mostly writes about her daily adventures. Her posts are kind of long, but they are funny and down-to-earth. Also, she has a monthly drawing for free web banners. How cool!
