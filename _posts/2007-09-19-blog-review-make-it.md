_This is the first in a new series of quick posts called **blog reviews**. I hope to review a couple craft and swapping related blogs each week. They will be blogs with great crafting tips, info, and ideas, or just fun and inspirational content. I hope you enjoy discovering new blogs as much as I do! If you have a suggestion for a future blog review (including your own blog), email me at: rachel [at] swap-bot [dot] com._
