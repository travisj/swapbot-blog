A little late today, but I still love you! Check out these crafty and fun-filled links:

  * It is indie craft fair season! Check out the [comprehensive calendar of craft fairs](http://craftershock.com/indiecraftfairguide/) on Craftershock to find one near you.
  * I&#8217;m posting this a little late for Earth Day, but [Simple Mom](http://simplemom.net/) has a great list of [40 Tips to Go Greener at Home](http://simplemom.net/tips-to-go-green-at-home/).
  * I am excited about this: [A new &#8220;Etsy Addict&#8221; iPhone application](http://www.etsy.com/storque/how-to/handmade-code-new-etsy-addict-iphone-application-3867/)! It allows you to quickly check your fave Etsy sellers for updates via your iPhone and it is just $.99. (You can purchase it at the [App Store](http://danieldickison.com/etsyaddict/).)
  * I love this [free pattern](http://heatherross.squarespace.com/journal/2008/8/5/free-dress-pattern-download-for-mendocino-fabrics.html) from Heather Ross and Mendocino Fabrics for a cute, smocked summer dress&#8230; too bad I don&#8217;t know how to smock. Wait a second &#8211; here is a [free tutorial on smocking](http://pretty-ditty.blogspot.com/2009/04/smockingshirring-tutorial.html) from Pretty Ditty! Perfect!
  * These [Post-It note drawings](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcjohns/sets/72157594384659839/) by [Marc Johns](http://www.marcjohns.com/) have been cracking me up. (found via [Twig & Thistle](http://www.twigandthistle.com/blog/2009/04/h-is-for-holycrap/))
  * I like the cute [pirate card tutorial](http://www.etsy.com/storque/how-to/how-tuesday-ahoy-there-pop-up-pirate-card-3781/) featured on the Etsy Storque on Tuesday&#8230; great for a little boy&#8217;s (or girl&#8217;s) birthday!
