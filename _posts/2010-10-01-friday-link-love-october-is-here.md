Since it is now officially October, I couldn&#8217;t help but put together a list of Halloween-inspired links&#8230;

  * Now this is a themed dinner party! A very detailed and wild [Witches Dinner Party](http://www.pizzazzerie.com/parties/holidays/witches-dinner-party/) on pizzazzerie (and seen above).
  * Classy [DIY Pumpkin Place Cards](http://www.twigandthistle.com/blog/2010/09/diy-pumpkin-place-cards/) on Twig & Thistle.
  * These are adorable: [Monster Brownies](http://www.amandascookin.com/2010/09/monster-brownies.html) on Amanda&#8217;s Cookin
  * This seems a little bit complicated, but creates a very cool effect: [Spider web balloons](http://www.craftycrafty.tv/2008/09/halloween_how_to_make_spider_w.html) on Crafty Crafty.
  * These are totally gross and totally cool: [Bloody Brain Cupcakes](http://bakeitinacake.com/recipes/bloodybraincupcakes) on Bake It In a Cake. There is a little marzipan brain inside each cupcake!
  * Theres a round up of unique [Halloween decorating projects](http://blairpeter.typepad.com/weblog/2010/09/halloween-projects.html) on Wise Craft
  * No, I haven&#8217;t been paid to say this, I just really love the new [Halloween stuff](http://www.eksuccessbrands.com/marthastewartcrafts/productlist.htm?tid=244) from Martha Stewart Crafts. 

And, if you aren&#8217;t in the spooky spirit yet, here are some general crafty goodies&#8230;

  * Snail mail lovers are everywhere! Check out the [You&#8217;ve Got Mail Project](http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Youve-Got-Mail-Project/318589518435). Write to Your Pal Carl, and he&#8217;ll write back!
  * This blog has been going on all year, so you may have already see it, but if not: Lisa Congdon&#8217;s [A Collection A Day 2010](http://collectionaday2010.blogspot.com/). She has some very interesting collections!
  * I love the look of these [DIY colored mason jars](http://100layercake.com/blog/archives/9009) on 100 Layer Cake.
  * This is sweet and colorful: [Printable Owl Mobile](http://www.skiptomylou.org/2010/09/30/printable-owl-mobile/) on Skip To My Lou.
  * And speaking of printables, Whip Up has a pretty extensive [round-up of free printables](http://whipup.net/2010/09/30/printables-roundup/). There is some really cute stuff on that list!

As always, feel free to add more crafty links in the comments!
