I have not done one of these in a while, but here is a lonely edition of Friday Link Love:

  * [Swap-bot was mentioned on the blog](http://www.frankie.com.au/new/index.php/component/content/article/51-all-sorts/119-swap-shop) of hip, Australian magazine, [Frankie](http://www.frankie.com.au/new/index.php/latest-issue). We were also mentioned in May on [TrendCentral](http://www.trendcentral.com/WebApps/App/SnapShots/Article.aspx?ArticleId=7369). Press is great. Let us know if you see Swap-bot mentioned anywhere.
  * For matchbox lovers, you must see Abigail Brown&#8217;s [matchbox birds](http://www.abigail-brown.co.uk/birds_boxes1.html) and [creatures in boxes](http://www.abigail-brown.co.uk/creatures_box1.html). So adorably pretty.
  * Two fun sites created by my friends that you gotta check out: [bumberstickr](http://bumperstickr.com/) & [hilarious.net](http://www.hilarious.net/) <em style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?wonder_woman">Wonder Woman on dvd</a></em>
