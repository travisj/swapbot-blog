Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day, swap friends! I hope you have a lovely Saturday. 

&#8211; Remember, you have one week left to enter for the [February Giveaway for the Doodlebug scrapbook supplies](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/01/31/february-giveaway-enter-to-win/) . The winner will be randomly chosen on Saturday, February 21st.

&#8211; For those of you in the US Pacific Northwest, plans for the [Swap-bot Member Appreciation Event](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/02/01/swap-bot-member-appreciation-event/) are coming along nicely. The event will be held on Sunday, March 1st, from 12 &#8211; 3 pm at the Lamb Cottage in Skinner&#8217;s Butter Park (<a href=http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&rls=en-us&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=155+High+St+Eugene+OR&fb=1&split=1&gl=us&cid=0,0,7849176457938046652&ei=1teVSZSjEIKOsQP75ZGjBw&sa=X&oi=local_result&resnum=1&ct=image">101 Cheshire Ave, Eugene, OR 97401</a>). All area Swap-bot members are invited. The event promises to be a lot of fun. Snacks and drinks will be provided &#8211; including cupcakes! There will be a few activities, including an ATC trade, but also plenty of time for socializing and chatting. Plus, we will be giving away lots of amazing door prizes! I am looking forward to it!

&#8211; Any crafty bloggers out there? Swap-bot is looking for help with the Swap-bot blog! We would love to publish your original article or craft tutorial. All guest posts would link back to the author&#8217;s personal blog or website. Let me know if you are interested in contributing. Email: rachel [at] swap-bot.com </strong> </div>
