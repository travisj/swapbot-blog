Better late than never, here are the three randomly chosen winners of the March/April Giveaway for Swap-bot t-shirts and other goodies:

**Christine Makai aka [mystic69](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mystic69):** _&#8220;I heard about swapbot from an email buddy&#8230;. I just did two swaps (still waiting for my candy bar!) and am finding the experience awesome!&#8221;_ 

**Ellen aka [ellie1200](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ellie1200):** _&#8220;Ooh! I love to share the story of how I found swap-bot! I’d been searching the web for a crochet pattern. Someone had asked me about making them some “soakers” for cloth diapers (I didn’t even know what those were till I started looking around!). Anyway, somehow I ended up at a swap-bot member’s blog, momwithahook. She didn’t have a soaker pattern, but she did have some pictures of absolutely adorable crocheted stuffies that she’d made for a swap-bot swap. I just had to see what that cuteness was about, clicked a link, and I was hooked!&#8221;_

**Robin Rodgers aka [biasbabe](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:biasbabe):** _&#8220;Wow, were to begin. I ran into the site of Swap-bot over two years ago on doing a search for swaps. The word swaps will take you to alot of places not just here if you know what I mean LoL. I clicked on the site link which had brought me to the main site, and just by seeing all the neat projects that everyone had completed was enough for me to venture on in. That was the first thing that peeked my senses. Then when it said it was a free membership then that really was awesome. I figured if I didn’t like it I would drop out gracefully. Well as you might have guessed it, that was all it took for me to get hooked on this site. many awesome projects and the next best thing to having a real family and a family of wonderful swappers to share my love of crafting, swapping and sewing. What more could I ask for, nothing absolutely nothing.&#8221;_ 

Congratulations to the winners!! I will be contacting you to get your t-shirt sizes and then I hope to have your prizes mailed out by the end of the week.
