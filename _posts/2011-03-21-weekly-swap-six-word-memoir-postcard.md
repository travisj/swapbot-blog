This week&#8217;s featured swap is the [Your Memoir in Six Words Postcard Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/85947) hosted by [AlyssD](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:AlyssD). I love the idea behind this swap: Write the story of your life in only six words. 

For inspiration and examples, watch the short video above. It is the promo piece for the book, [_Not Quite What I Was Planning: Six-Word Memoirs by Writers Famous and Obscure_](http://www.amazon.com/Not-Quite-What-Was-Planning/dp/0061374059), a collection of these short and poignant memoirs.

The postcard swap is international and open for sign up through March 30th. For the swap, you will write your memoir in only six words on the back of three postcards (of your choosing) and send one (naked, i.e. not in an envelope) to each of your three partners. Everyone, including new users is welcome in this swap. 

Swap-bot&#8217;s Memoir: Sent item, got one back. Sweet.
