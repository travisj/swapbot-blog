They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

Meet our next Ambassador, [Lanie](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Lanie)! Lanie has been a member of Swap-bot since 2010 but she is selective about her swaps, completing a total of 46. She loves Harry Potter, sci-fi, and chocolate&#8230; sounds like she and I have a lot in common!! 

**Ambassador Region:** Florida, USA<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lanie.jpg" alt="lanie" width="300" height="336" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11283" />

**How Lanie found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I think it was through a thread on Etsy but not 100% sure as it was like 4 years ago.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I love it because it&#8217;s easy to use, you meet lots of great people and you get to share your talents with them.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;I like swaps where I can really use my talents and make things to send to others. Sometimes though I don&#8217;t always get the same effort in return but at least the person tried. &#8221; 

**Check out two of Lanie&#8217;s wonderful altered tin swaps:**

**Interesting facts about Lanie:** &#8220;I tend to be a bit eccentric and come off as &#8220;annoying&#8221; to some but it&#8217;s just that I am a bit too blunt at times and have a unique personality.&#8221;
