Our special [10th anniversary mail art swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/206850) has now concluded, and all of the awesome mail art is reaching its destinations. The requirements of the swap were easy: send one piece of Swap-bot themed mail art to your partner. Many of the swap participants were kind enough to send along images of their creations so that I could share them here for everyone to admire. 

There were so many great pieces of art that I had to split them up into two blog posts. [Check out the first post of images by clicking here.](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2015/10/23/10th-anniversary-mail-art-swap-items-part-1/)

Mail package and interactive journal by [PrairieKittin](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:PrairieKittin): _&#8221; I made a journal for my partner to use. The mailing label has Swap-bot on the front and back. When you open it, the first thing you see is the &#8220;I love Swap-bot&#8221; logo. On the title page is the Tree of Life. The next page has an envelope.. but not just \*any\* envelope! When you open the flap, it says PULL on the inside of the flap. You pull it and a bi-fold note page is attached. The facing page has room to write another journal entry.The last page has another envelope with Zentangles on it. Inside that envelope is a letter.&#8221;_

ATC and envelope by [dodothefairy](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:dodothefairy): _&#8220;I did an ATC, that is quite symbolic because there is the world, a stamp, the number ten and a set of pencils. It represents the letters that swap-bot let go trough the world since ten years. I decorated the envelope using drawings of imagined stamp.&#8221;_

Package mailed by [Artistic](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Artistic): _&#8220;My partner likes postage stamps, so that&#8217;s why there are so many, including a couple of vintage ones. My blue watercolor pen was a little too dark on the postcard replica, so I added the blue and orange mats and the curling ribbon. I should have known that &#8220;indigo&#8221; and &#8220;tangerine&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t be spot on.  <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />The packet is big because I included two little &#8220;anniversary&#8221; gifts wrapped in white tissue paper with blue and orange ribbon.&#8221;_

The thing I love most about art is seeing how creatively and how uniquely each individual expresses a given theme. I LOVE all of your creations. Thank you so much for swapping on Swap-bot and for celebrating our 10th anniversary with us. xoxo
