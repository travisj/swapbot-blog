I&#8217;ve got two weeks worth of awesome links for you today&#8230; there is a wide variety, so enjoy!

  * These [star cupcakes](http://inchmark.squarespace.com/inchmark/2009/6/24/star-cupcakes.html/) (seen above) from [inchmark](http://inchmark.squarespace.com/) are so sweet and clever. They were made for a space-themed birthday party, but I think they would be a big hit at a Labor Day party, too! (Labor Day is a US holiday happening this weekend, for all of our international friends.)
  * Speaking of cupcakes, I am intrigued by these [five different potato chip cupcakes on Cupcakes Take the Cake](http://cupcakestakethecake.blogspot.com/2010/09/5-potato-chip-cupcakes.html).
  * Another Labor Day worthy treat: [adorable &#8220;poptarts&#8221;-on-a-stick recipe from The Family Kitchen](http://blogs.babble.com/family-kitchen/2010/09/01/poptart-pops-an-interview-with-bakerella/). 
      * **For all ATC creators:** The Richmond Art Gallery is currently requesting entries for their huge upcoming [5th Annual Artist Trading Card Exhibition](http://www.richmondartgallery.org/ATCs-exhibition-2010.php). Anyone can submit 9 ATCs which will be exhibited in the show, and then you will also receive 9 ATCs from other exhibited artists after the show is over. Read the [official info page](http://www.richmondartgallery.org/ATCs-exhibition-2010.php) for more details. What a great opportunity to have your artwork shown in a real gallery!
      * IndieSmiles.com is celebrating its one-year birthday this month by holding a [donation drive and photo contest to support the ASPCA (the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals)](http://www.indiesmiles.com/indiesmiles-celebrates-birthday-for-aspca-charity/). Everyone who donates $5 to the cause is eligible to enter the photo contests with a chance to win big prizes.
      * This is so cool!! [Sketch Swap](http://www.sketchswap.com/) &#8211; It is a web application that let&#8217;s you immediately swap a digital drawing with another random sketcher from anywhere in the world. It is an anonymous process and you never know what kind of drawing you&#8217;ll get in return! Plus, you get to see your swap partner&#8217;s drawing unfold just as they drew it. Fascinating.
      * Wow! [Check out this amazing art made entirely from envelopes.](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2010/09/envelope_art_from_francisca_pr.html)
      * I think this [_Doodle Diary_](http://www.craftypod.com/2010/09/01/review-and-giveaway-doodle-diary/) reviewed on CraftyPod looks adorable and so fun. &#8230;and she is giving away a copy! Comment on the blog post to enter.
      * If you like crafting flowers, this [round-up of over three dozen flower tutorials on Oopsey Daisy](http://oopsey-daisy.blogspot.com/2010/07/wednesdays-wowzers-3-dozen-plus-four.html) is an amazing resource!
      * I love this [sweet strawberry pillow tutorial on the purl bee.](http://www.purlbee.com/strawberry-pillows/)
      * Remember those [cute bacon bookmarks I linked to on August 20th](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/08/20/friday-link-love-august-20th-2010/)? Well, you can now get [bacon fabric](http://www.spoonflower.com/fabric_items/new?design_id=326281) created by the designer Mollie Johanson, of [Wild Olive](http://wildolive.blogspot.com/2010/09/stripes-of-bacon.html)! She doesn&#8217;t even eat bacon, but she sure makes it look adorable!
      * So wild &#8211; [geeky nail art](http://www.girlsocool.com/blog/makeover/20-geeky-painted-nail-designs/).
      * Check out this wonderful craft blog, [Naughty&#8217;s Hidden Stash](http://naughtyhasahiddenstash.blogspot.com/), written by our own, [NaughtyElf](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:NaughtyElf). It has some fabulous ATC and altered art inspiration!
      * Four more new, cute blogs I discovered recently: [Wolf and Willow](http://www.wolfandwillowblog.com/), [oh, hello, friend](http://www.ohhellofriend.blogspot.com/), [Make Do & Send](http://makedoandsend.squarespace.com/), [heartmade](http://heartmadeblog.com/).
      * These two awesome reviews of Swap-bot made my day: [6 Reasons I Love Swap-bot](http://www.squidoo.com/10-reasons-to-love-swap-bot) by Swap-bot user, [fuzzington](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:fuzzington), and [If you craft, you should swap](http://dillpicklepicnic.com/2010/08/23/swap-bot-review/) by Swap-bot user, [CraftySmurfette](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:craftysmurfette). Thanks for the awesome write-ups!</ul> 
    I am so excited for the long weekend, but I have already packed it full of activities! What will you be doing this weekend?</ul>
