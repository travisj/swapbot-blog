Looking through all of the available Swap-bot swaps always makes me happy. There are so many to choose from in every possible theme &#8211; I love it! 

The wide range of choices also makes it hard to choose just one featured swap each week, but I managed to narrow it down to a few Dotee Doll swaps this week: 

  * **[How much is that Dog Dotee in the Window](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/69234)** &#8211; A cute, unique, and international dotee doll swap hosted by [CozetteAsahi](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CozetteAsahi). (Love the swap title!) Last day to sing up is today!!
  * **[Clown Dotee](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/67905)** &#8211; An international swap hosted by [mlbstudios](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mlbstudios). Open for sign up until this Saturday, August 28th. 
  * **[Spooky Halloween Dotee](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/67903)** &#8211; International swap also hosted by [mlbstudios](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mlbstudios). Sign up before September 1st. 
      * **[Mushroom Dotee](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/70743)** &#8211; International and hosted by [CozetteAsahi](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CozetteAsahi). You have until September 11th to sign up.
      * **[Robot Dotee](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/70537)** &#8211; I think robot dotee dolls would be so cute! If you agree, sign up for the international swap, hosted by [obliviousfire](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:obliviousfire), by September 30th.</ul> 
    All of these Dotee Doll themes sound so fun and unique &#8211; I can&#8217;t wait to see the finished products!
