I am a little late with this week&#8217;s featured swap, but I have chosen the [Nature Books](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2328) <em style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?speed">Speed the movie</a></em> swap hosted by [Pablo](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=7). The Nature Books swap is an easy one-partner swap for those nature lovers out there. It is open to join through March 15th, so you have plenty of time to find a cool nature book to swap and tell your friends to join in!

p.s. If you truly are a nature lover, you should check out Pablo&#8217;s blog, [Roundrock Journal](http://www.roundrockjournal.com/). It contains daily nature writings as well as photographs like the ones seen here.
