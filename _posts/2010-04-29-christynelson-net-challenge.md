ChristyNelson.net is a great crafty website and Christy also hosts monthly craft challenges. Myself and two other lucky Swap-botters got to participate in the and we were each sent a package which contained black felt, burlap, safety pins, and black sequins. Each Challenge participant received the same materials and we were each to make any project we could dream up as long as we used at least some of each Challenge item. Check out what I made! It is a 5 x 7&#8243; wallet made with the felt. I used the burlap, rosettes, and sequins as decorative elements, and closed it with a safety pin. I am pleased with how it turned out and how such a random assortments of things can be made into something functional and pretty! Sweet!<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/christychallenge.jpg" alt="christychallenge" title="christychallenge" width="470" height="326" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5229" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/christychallenge-300x208.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/christychallenge.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" />Lisa (Swap-bot user ) also participated in the challenge and she made this amazing .
