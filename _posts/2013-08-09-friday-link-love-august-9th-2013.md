Hello swap-loving friends! I have a few lovely little links for you&#8230;

  * I think I've shared this link before, but the packages from [The Happy Mail Project](http://thehappymailproject.blogspot.com) (like the one seen above) are just so beautiful and inspiring. They deserve a second look.
  * These [For The Makers DIY kit subscriptions](http://fab.com/sale/24864?page=1) on Fab.com look fun and interesting.
  * This would be a fun craft to make for a kid's party favors: [Fish-in-a-Bag Soaps.](http://www.pbs.org/parents/crafts-for-kids/fish-in-a-bag-soaps/)
  * And speaking of parties, check out the [three DIY ideas for glitzy glam cake toppers](http://www.etsy.com/blog/en/2013/how-tuesday-three-cake-toppers/) on the Etsy blog. 
      * If you love beautiful, hand-printed textiles, check out my friend Tyshawn's [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rbsnynow/red-bridge-studio-debuts-new-designs-at-new-york-n) for her Brooklyn-based biz, Red Bridge Studio. She has some awesome incentives.
      * This [Brownie Bottom Ice Cream Cake](http://cookiesandcups.com/brownie-bottom-ice-cream-cake/) looks pretty darn delicious!
      * And these [Strawberry Lemonade Whoopie Pies](http://www.bakersroyale.com/cakes/strawberry-lemonade-whoopie-pies/) also look awesome. Yum! </ul>
