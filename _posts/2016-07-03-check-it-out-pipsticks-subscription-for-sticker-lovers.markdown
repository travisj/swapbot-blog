Do you love stickers? And snail mail?? Of course you do! And so do I. I have been collecting stickers since I was in grade school and can't bear to part with much of my collection. It is a little crazy, but I know I am not the only one out there with a slight obsession with stickers.

Late last year, I discovered [Pipsticks](https://www.pipsticks.com/) via Swap-bot user [luluvision's](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:luluvision) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/8n-V37jttx/). In April, I couldn't resist any longer and I subscribed to the monthly sticker mailing! Above you can see how my first Pipsticks mailing arrived. I love how the sticker packs are mailed with real stamps, and the vellum envelopes are so lovely. The packs are basically excellent mail art stuffed with stickers! Below you can see some of the contents of that first sticker pack I received. The stickers are all high quality from a wide range of manufacturers, including some I've never seen before. Of course, there are hits and misses when it comes to loving everything in these types of surprise subscription services, but so far, I really like and know I will use the majority of what I have received in my two Pipsticks mailings.

Pipsticks was started in September of 2014 by Maureen, a mom of four living in California. The full Pipsticks operation is run by her and her husband in a small cottage on their property. They send stickers to thousands of subscribers in over 50 countries! Wow. You can read a lot more about the business in [this interview on Babyccino](http://babyccinokids.com/blog/2016/06/13/5-questions-with-maureen-from-pipsticks/).

There are a couple different Pipsticks [subscription options](https://pipsticks.com/refer/Rache-HPUBCOBI) for both kids and adults, but all of them come with lots of stickers and some extra paper goodies. The larger subscriptions come with a pre-stamped postcard that you can decorate with your stickers and pop in the mail -- perfect for our postcard swaps!
