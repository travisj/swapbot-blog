We have been working hard this weekend to release some pretty cool site updates for you today. The site changes/improvements are listed below. Check them out and let us know how you like them or if you notice anything weird going on. Thanks! xoxo

  * **Most important:** The [automatic account suspension system](http://swap-bot.com/blog/2007/11/24/automatic-account-suspensions/) is now completely operational. This means that if a swapper receives four, or more, &#8220;1&#8221; ratings within the past six months, their account is automatically partially suspended by the Swap-bot computer. They are dropped from all swaps in which partners are not yet assigned and they are not able to sign up for new swaps until they get their low ratings rectified. This means that if you have four, or more, &#8220;1&#8221; ratings from the past six months on your account right now, you will not be allowed to sign up for any new swaps until you are able to improve some of those ratings.
  * There are three new email notifications that you will be receiving: (1) when/if your account is partially suspended due to four, or more, &#8220;1&#8221; ratings; (2) when a rating you have given receives a response; (3) when you receive a comment on your profile. The last two email notifications have been requested by many users, but we have also made them optional if you prefer. To &#8220;opt out&#8221; of the rating response and profile comment email notifications, go to the new **Preferences** section of the profile edit screen. You can also choose not to receive the email notification for new ratings on this screen. The default is set so that you DO receive all email notifications. You must edit your profile preferences to stop receiving any of the three optional notifications. (Many Swap-bot email notifications, such as those for swap deadlines, are not optional at this time.)
  * Your country is now listed on your profile page under last login. This is NOT optional at this time. Your country is listed exactly as you typed it in you account address.
  * Your current swaps on the &#8220;Your Swaps&#8221; page are now listed by mail deadline instead of sign up deadline. This makes it so that the &#8220;Your Swaps&#8221; list matches the &#8220;Currently In&#8221; list on the profile pages.
  * You can now mark swaps as NOT sent if/when you accidentally mark them as &#8220;Sent&#8221; before you mean to. This option is located in the swap&#8217;s info box on the swap&#8217;s main page to the right of the &#8220;Sent Items Status:&#8221; field. You cannot perform this option from the &#8220;Your Swaps&#8221; page; you must view the individual swap page to do it.
  * The date that each participant marked a swap as &#8220;Sent&#8221; is now visible on the &#8220;View complete list of swap participants&#8221; page. This information is visible for both participants and coordinators of the swap. However, this new bit of information cannot be displayed retroactively, so all swaps that have been marked &#8220;Sent&#8221; prior to today will not have a date associated with them. Sorry. 
  * Lastly, the list of recipients you have sent messages to in the Swap-bot message center are now listed in alphabetical order. However, the alphabetical ordering system is not perfect as users who have not logged in for months (and still only have their old display names) are not sorted alphabetically. Their names will appear at the end of the list.

We hope you enjoy the new changes. Happy swapping!
