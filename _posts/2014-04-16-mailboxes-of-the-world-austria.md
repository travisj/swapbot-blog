I had never been to Austria before and I was amazed by the beauty of the city of Vienna. I spied this mailbox just outside the [Ringstrasse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringstra√üe) and the city center. The Austrian postal service logo, colors, and mailboxes are very similar to Germany&#8217;s.

I also really liked these funny, promotional postal service displays inside the post office, where I mailed a LOT of postcards! 

_Next stop, Italy!_
