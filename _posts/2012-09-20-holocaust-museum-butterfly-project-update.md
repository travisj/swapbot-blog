The [Holocaust Museum Butterfly Project #2 Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/118253) is completed and the collected butterflies will be mailed off to the [Houston Holocaust Museum](http://www.hmh.org/ed_butterfly1.shtml) asap.

The swap was organized by [Leashah](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Leashah) and [TerryF](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TerryF) and they compiled these Final Numbers:

  * 4100 Butterflies (The ones seen above were made by [bluehairedmary](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:bluehairedmary).)

  * 42 US States Represented
  * A special mention must be made of [JMM876](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:JMM876) who made over 1,000 origami butterflies!

Wow! What impressive numbers! And, what a great swap and project! Thank you to everyone who participated and especially to the organizers, [Leashah](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Leashah) and [TerryF](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TerryF).
