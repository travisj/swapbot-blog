I have a present for you! I got inspired and made these cute Swap-bot Valentines and matching envelope. One features Ernie the envie decked out for the holiday, and the other features Crusher. Crusher loves you!

The PDF file is totally free and you simply download it, print it out on card stock, cut out your Valentines, and give them to your friends! You could also use them as swap cards to include in your swap packages.

There are some basic instructions on the PDF, but assembly is really easy. Cut just inside the black lines, then score and fold the envelope on the grey lines. Fold in the shorter sides of the envelope, then the bottom. You can glue these parts together. Slip your Valentine card inside the envelope, fold down the top, seal it, and give it to someone you love!

Crusher was so excited about these cards that he already started handing his out!
