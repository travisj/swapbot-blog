[Unanimous Craft](http://www.unanimouscraft.com/) is a cool, new website (just launched in March of this year) where you can find hundreds of resources for indie businesses and crafters. The site is a directory and a community that anyone can join. Once you are a member &#8212; there is a free and a premium pay option &#8212; you can submit your favorite websites and resources or review the current listings. 

From the site description: 

_&#8220;Unanimous Craft is a tagable, sortable index of resources for crafters, artists and indie business owners. We submit our favorite resources and welcome the community to do the same. Once you become a member, you can submit resources you like, review and rate other resources and curate lists of your favorites.&#8221;_

Unanimous Craft is pretty and easy to navigate. I have been having fun adding some of my favorite resources, like Swap-bot and Craft Critique, and writing a few reviews. If you have been looking for a place to store a directory of your favorite craft websites and resources, I definitely recommend Unanimous Craft. 

(p.s. I would be pumped if you would add a review of [Swap-bot](http://www.unanimouscraft.com/resources/swap-bot) on Unanimous Craft.)
