Despite the poor economic climate, swapping can still be affordable and lots of fun! This week&#8217;s featured swap is the [No-Spending Swap III](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/26897) hosted by [Banshee](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Banshee). For this swap, each participant sends their one partner items that they already have on hand. From the swap description:

_&#8220;For swappers who are low on cash or have a growing stash of nice but unused/not-needed swap items. The objective of this swap is to not spend any money to buy items for the swap, but to send items you already have. What to send? You will send at least 3 items, worth about US$5, to your swap partner. Examples of swap items can be, but not limited to, embroidery floss, fat quarters, assorted teas, stationery, postcards, stickers, etc.&#8221;_ 

The sign up deadline for this **international** swap is February 5th and new users are welcome to participate if they have a full profile. The send deadline for the No-Spending Swap III is February 14th. This swap is a great reminder that we still have valuable things to share even during a recession!
