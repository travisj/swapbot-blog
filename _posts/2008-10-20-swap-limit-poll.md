Originally we wanted Swap-bot to be as free as possible with members each being personally responsible for their behavior and swap reputation. However, lately we have been warming up to the idea of a swap limit for all swappers (not just new users). The tricky part is deciding how many active swaps each user should be limited to sign up for. Should the limit be based on a swapper&#8217;s experience (the number of swaps they have completed) and rating history? How many swaps do you think is a reasonable limit for established swappers? PLease answer this poll and add your comments. It would be most helpful to know how many swaps you believe is a fair limit.
