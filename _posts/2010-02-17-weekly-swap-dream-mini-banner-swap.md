      [        <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/banner.jpg" alt="banner" title="banner" width="200" height="99" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4943" />](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/54858)This week&#8217;s featured swap is the hosted by . Pennant banners (or bunting, or garland, depending on where you are from) are very popular right now, and for good reason! They are a fun and easy way to decorate a space for a party, or for everyday. This swap requires that each participant create their own original pennant banner with five triangles or squares which spell out the word &#8220;DREAM&#8221; attached to a ribbon or cord. The triangles or squares should each be the size of an Artist Trading Card (2.5 x 3.5 inches) and they should be created in a vintage style. 

More info from the swap description on the style: &#8220;Senders choice color-wise, but it MUST be soft and dreamy and vintage in style &#8211; a touch of glitter is always nice. You can start creating as soon as you sign up. Think vintage trims and tassels, think ribbon and lace. Vintage embellishments would be nice, but any cute pictures or stickers that match, diamontes or flowers. I usually add a fringe, tassels or beading to each bottom but its up to you.&#8221; 

The swap is international and open for sign up through February 26th.
