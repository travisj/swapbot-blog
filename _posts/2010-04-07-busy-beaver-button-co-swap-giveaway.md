I love buttons! Specifically one-inch, pin-back buttons that many companies and artists use to promote their work, like the Swap-bot buttons seen above. I have a huge collection! 

My favorite place to order the pin-back buttons I design is I have been ordering from Busy Beaver for years for both personal designs and Swap-bot buttons. I love their quality and their awesome customer service, so I was excited when they offered to sponsor a button swap and a giveaway on the &#8216;bot!
