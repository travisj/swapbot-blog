What is a mug rug? A mug rug is a cross between a coaster and a placemat. It is a handy thing to have on your desk as a place to set your coffee/tea and a little snack. Often mug rugs are quilted (like the one seen above from [Sew Fantastic](http://sew-fantastic.blogspot.com/2011/03/mug-rug-tutorial-scrappy-colorblock.html)) and they are good way to use up fabric scraps, but I&#8217;ve also seen them woven. 

Are you a fiber or fabric crafter who wants to try out this quick, new craft? Join the [Fun with Mug Rugs swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/94034)! The international swap is being hosted by [theprincessr](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:theprincessr). For the swap you make one 5 x 7 inch mug rug for your one partner. All swappers must be experienced and have over a 4.7 rating. Join the swap before this Saturday, July 16th.
