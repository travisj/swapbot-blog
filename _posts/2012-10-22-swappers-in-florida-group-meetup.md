**Over the weekend, a group of members from the [Swappers in Florida Group](http://www.swap-bot.com/group/3ac77bf8854d7129ab893f0e1776a927/about) got together for a day of crafting. [TurtleLady45](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:turtlelady45) sent in this fabulous and fun report:**

_The Swappers in Florida Group held a &#8216;Craft Day&#8217; October 20 at the Ridge Clubhouse, Davenport, FL. Thanks [Silwygurl](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Silwygurl) for getting the room for us! Ten crafty ladies_ [seen above are Michelle &#8212; rep for Close to My Heart, [RyeRye](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:RyeRye), [Stampsnob](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Stampsnob), [TurtleLady45](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:turtlelady45), [Geminigirl](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Geminigirl), [KitchenDiva](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KitchenDiva), [Craftchallenged](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Craftchallenged), [Snoop](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Snoop), [Bluecrayons](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Bluecrayons), [Silwygurl](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Silwygurl)] _from all over Florida attended. [TurtleLady45](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:turtlelady45) organized the day. <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/turtlelady45.jpg" alt="" title="turtlelady45" width="191" height="301" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9216" />She made name tags for both our SB and our real names, but we mostly called each other by our SB names! True to her name, Turtlelady45, wore a tee-shirt with turtles on it as well as a turtle hat!_ [Love it!]

_After getting acquainted for a while, we started off the day with demos by [Snoop](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Snoop). She showed us how to make an Ice Card and a Black Enamel Love mask card (ATC size). [RyeRye](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:RyeRye) continued with a demo of the round looms found in craft stores. She was making a hat.</p> 

We broke for a potluck lunch. Oh! What yummy foods&#8230;mac & tuna salad, bean salad, pear, almond & blue cheese with greens, meatballs, pork sliders, zucchini bread, brownies, and snacks.

Then, we had a gift bag swap. Each lady brought a gift bag with goodies in it. One by one we took a bag, but the &#8216;catch&#8217; was if you liked what someone else got, you took it from them&#8230;they would get to take another bag. We all received some wonderful craft supplies.

After lunch, [Wickedred](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Wickedred) gave a workshop in polymer clay. Each lady brought a package of clay and we all made turtles! Such a variety of turtles in various colors. And, Michelle, a rep from Close to My Heart, taught us how to make a corner bookmark.

It was a fun day. We got to put faces to names! We talked, we ate, we crafted. Swappers in Florida hope to have craft days every few months.</i>
