And this time it was a total surprise&#8230; a friend recently clued me into the fact that Swap-bot is mentioned on page 89 of the September 2011 issue of [Disney Family Fun magazine](http://familyfun.go.com/magazine/). We are mentioned in an article about ATCs as a good place to find ATC swaps. That is definitely true! 

If you ever see Swap-bot mentioned in print or online publications, please let me know! It helps me figure out how users are learning about the &#8216;bot.
