ATC stands for [Artist Trading Card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist_trading_cards), and they are one of the most popular items being traded on [Swap-bot](http://www.swap-bot.com) these days. I figured it was about time that an ATC swap was featured here on the blog, and then I stumbled upon this funny and clever swap: [The Dating Game ATCs swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2565) hosted by [wackystuff](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4006). (BTW, wackystuff is a fabulous swap coordinator who has a perfect 5 rating and 10 hearts after participating in over 40 swaps! wow!) The Dating Game ATCs swap is an international swap and each swapper has two partners to which they send 3 ATCS. Here is what the swap description says:

> Swap-bot is like a blind date, so letâ€™s make Artist Trading Cards of Bachelor #1, Bachelor #2 and Bachelor #3. These could be portraits of your ideal date or some of the less than perfect characters that have crossed your path. Make a set of 3 ATCs each for 2 swap partners. All media welcome.

How fun and funny! Will you send your swap partners three hunks, three nerds, three celebrities, or some combination? Be creative and make up clever descriptions for each of your bachelors. Make your partners laugh!
