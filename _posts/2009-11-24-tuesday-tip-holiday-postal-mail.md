With December right around the corner, the USPS is gearing up for another busy holiday mailing season. The USPS has released its holiday shipping dates. Even if you are not concerned about getting your package to someone by December 25th, keep in mind that mailing and shipping times can be much longer during the holidays. If you do want a package to arrive by Christmas (especially internationally) mail it as early as possible!!

**USPS Holiday Mail Deadlines:**

**First Class Mail:** Domestic &#8211; Dec-21, International &#8211; Dec 4
  
**Priority Mail:** Domestic &#8211; Dec-21, International &#8211; Dec 4
  
**Express Mail:** Domestic &#8211; Dec-23, International &#8211; Dec 12
