Travis worked hard all weekend to make you a fancy, new present: [The Swap-bot Discussion Forums!](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/) Now there is a place within Swap-bot where you can ask for help, share ideas, or just chat. So far, we have created five main forum categories: General, Craft Chat, Bad Swappers, Ideas & Suggestions, and Help & Questions. Anyone can view the Swap-bot Forums, but you must be a Swap-bot member and be logged in if you want to reply to any of the topics or create your own topic within any of the categories. 

We are going to be continuously updating and improving the [Forums](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/), so please lets us know what you would like to see. What other categories should we add? 

Go check out the [Forums](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/) and start your own Swap-bot discussion!<strong style="display:none"><a href="http://www.turtlesurvival.org/?broken_bridges">Broken Bridges trailer</a></strong>
