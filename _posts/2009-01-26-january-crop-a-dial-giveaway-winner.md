Here is ArtsyAthinaâ€™s answer to the question, **What is one way you preserve special memories?** :

ArtsyAthina on 04 Jan 2009: &#8220;I too love to make shrines, and take tons of pictures!!!!!
  
I also like making mini scrapbooks, for small but significant events in my life.&#8221; 

Thanks to everyone who entered the drawing. I loved reading all of the comments about how you preserve memories. I have ben inspired by many of the ideas! There will be another giveaway announced at the beginning of February, so check back.
