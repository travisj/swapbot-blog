S&#8217;mores are my favorite dessert and today is officially [S&#8217;more Day](http://www.holidayinsights.com/other/smoresday.htm)!! I already compiled a group of [S&#8217;more-themed handmade marketplace picks last summer](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/07/22/handmade-marketplace-smore-etsy-picks/), but there are always cute S&#8217;more creations to be found, like the [Teeny Tiny S&#8217;more Pocket Art](http://www.etsy.com/listing/28377072/original-teeny-tiny-smore-pocket-art) seen above from [cupcakemanor](http://www.etsy.com/shop/cupcakemanor?ref=pr_shop_more) on Etsy. It is a mini oil painting! So cool!

Check out these other S&#8217;more finds:
