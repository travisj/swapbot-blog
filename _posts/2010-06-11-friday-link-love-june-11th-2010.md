Hello, friends! It has been a while since my last link love blog post, so I have a lot of good stuff for you. Enjoy! 

  * Do you like that cheery garland seen above? You can make your own by following the on I Still Love You. It is such a simple idea, but creates such a unique and lovely result!
  * This is really funny and I can totally relate: (Due to her super-large craft stash, not due to bad behavior! ha!)
  * I had never heard of the until it was introduced to me by the Craft Critique editors. 
  * This may be slightly odd, but it is totally ingenious: Check out the dryer lint crafts (yes, dryer lint!) on this week.
  * You already know that I love postal mail, but you may not know that I also love letterpress stationery. is a beautiful design studio in Oregon that combines both!
  * Check out all of these fun summer recipes:
  * on Disney&#8217;s Family Fun site. (Father&#8217;s Day is June 20th in the US.)
  * Love this on Craft Gossip!
  * Mint and chocolate is my favorite combo, so I have got to try these on Joyful Abode.
  * on Chica and Jo.
  * Ok, I revise my statement above. S&#8217;mores is actually my favorite chocolate flavor combo and I must make this on Make and Takes asap!
  * How cool! 

  * If you live in the Chicago area, you should really consider going to the happening on June 18th. ()
  * Speaking of crafty get-togethers, two Swap-bot groups are hosting events this weekend: 
      * Tomorrow (June 12th) the is getting together in Carbondale, Illinois. Contact for more info.
      * Tomorrow the is meeting up in Columbus, Ohio. Contact for more info.
      * On Sunday (June 13th), Swap-bot members in the Washington, DC area are getting together at Clay Cafe Studios in Chantilly, Virginia. Contact for more info. 
      * For even more crafty fun, think about attending or hosting an event in honor of Etsy birthday on June 18th! And, if you&#8217;re hosting an event, check out these .</ul>
