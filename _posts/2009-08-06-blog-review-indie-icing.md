I found a fun new blog to share with you called [Indie Icing](http://www.indieicing.com/). It showcases the &#8220;sweetest finds in handmade&#8221; by featuring the authors&#8217; (Jessica, Christen, and Robin) favorite picks from Etsy.com and other handmade marketplaces. I sometimes find it intimidating to dive right into Etsy to try to find the best stuff, so I appreciate sources like [Indie Icing](http://www.indieicing.com/) that help me discover the most talented handmade sellers. The blog is divided into different categories including the general [Sweet Finds](http://www.indieicing.com/indie-icing/sweet-finds/), [Mini Monday collages](http://www.indieicing.com/indie-icing/mini-monday/), [Business Basics](http://www.indieicing.com/indie-icing/business-basics/), and [Giveaways](http://www.indieicing.com/indie-icing/giveaways/) . All of the sellers and items featured on Indie Icing are independently chosen and are not influenced by advertising, which makes it feel more like a curated show rather than a promotional tool. The site is updated multiple times per week with new finds and beautiful images. I recommend it to anyone who likes to admire and buy quality handmade goods.
