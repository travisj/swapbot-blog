User ratings was quietly released today. Rating and commenting on a user&#8217;s swap performance works, but the reporting side of things is lacking. Currently the reporting is on a member&#8217;s profile page, but I am afraid that page is going to turn into a mess. Any suggestions are welcome.

You can get to rating by viewing a swap you are in and clicking on the &#8216;rate your swap partners&#8217; link under the list of things you can do as a member of the swap.
