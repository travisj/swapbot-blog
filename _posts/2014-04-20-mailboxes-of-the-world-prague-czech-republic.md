When we were in Vienna we met up with some of our Brooklyn friends. When we went south to Venice, they went north to **Prague in the Czech Republic**. My friend Amanda sent me this photo of a mailbox she spotted there. 

[Czech Post](http://www.ceskaposta.cz/en/index) uses similar colors, logos, and boxes as its German and Austrian counterparts. It is cool to see all the different variations!

Happy snail mailing!
