For this international swap you create a handmade, blank journal or sketchbook to send to your one partner. The journal must be at least 4 x 5 inches in size, at least 1/2 inch in width, and hand-assembled &#8211; no store-bought books! You will need to know (or learn) some simple book binding techniques in order to create your journal for your partner, and you can choose to decorate your journal specifically for your partner according to their profile if you want it to be extra special. The swap is open to anyone, even new users, but you must sign up before May 9th.
