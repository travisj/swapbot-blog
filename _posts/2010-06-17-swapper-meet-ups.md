There were a lot of great Swap-bot meet-ups last week! Above is the group that met in Chantilly, Virginia, on Sunday. This is the group&#8217;s second meet-up and they have another planned for September. It looks like they made some fun clay masterpieces!

On Tuesday, I met up with two Swap-bot members in New York City. MissThundercat (on the left) came all the way from The Netherlands, and dreamrains (on the right) traveled from Boston. (I&#8217;m in the middle.) We had fun shopping a few craft stores in Soho, buying yarn and some stamp carving supplies. It is so awesome to meet swappers in person! I love it!

There were two other large meet-ups over the weekend in Illinois and Ohio. I hope to share photos from the events soon. I have already received some excellent reports about all the fun they had!
