Just a handful of links for you this week&#8230;

  * Adorableness alert! [Mochimochi Land](http://mochimochiland.com/) has a [free pattern](http://mochimochiland.com/2010/06/free-pattern-baby-gators/) for knitting those super-cute baby gators seen above.
  * For those interested in graphic design, I just discovered the [Good Look Cookbook](http://www.goodlookcookbook.com/), a blog that gives tips on how to create better designs. (via [ISLY](http://melissaesplin.com/home/2010/07/glcb-what-not-to-font/))
  * There was recently a wacky [Jello mold competition](http://www.gowanusstudio.org/jello/index.html) here in Brooklyn. Check out photos from the event on the [Martha Stewart Crafts Dept. blog](http://thecraftsdept.marthastewart.com/2010/07/jell-o-mold-competition.html).
  * Like many people, I am an avid user of Facebook&#8230; and I used the virtual &#8220;like&#8221; button to show my approval for these [real life &#8220;like&#8221; and &#8220;dislike&#8221; rubber stamps](http://shop.wearenation.co.uk/).
  * Planning any parties this summer? You&#8217;ll find tons of inspiration on these two party blogs: [Hip Hip Hooray!](http://hiphiphoorayblog.com/) and [Oh Happy Day!](http://www.jordanferney.blogspot.com/)
  * Ok, I know I&#8217;ve told you about the awesome helpfulness that is [Unanimous Craft](http://www.unanimouscraft.com/) &#8211; it is a directory of crafty resources &#8211; but have I begged you to write a review of [Swap-bot on UC](http://www.unanimouscraft.com/resources/swap-bot)? Let&#8217;s make Swap-bot the [most viewed resource of all time](http://www.unanimouscraft.com/popularity-contest/most-viewed-all-time)! 
  * I am planning to attend [Monday&#8217;s Etsy Craft Night](http://www.etsy.com/storque/events/come-craft-faux-felt-cakes-with-my-candy-castle-at-etsy-labs-9251/) in Brooklyn &#8211; the craft is felt food! Anyone else planning to be there?

Have a really fabulous weekend!!
