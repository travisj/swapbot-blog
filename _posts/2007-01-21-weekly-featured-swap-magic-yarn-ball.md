This is the exciting first installment of the Weekly Featured Swap! Every week we will pick a swap that we believe is a great example of an interesting, fun, and well-organized swap. We will make sure the featured swap is open for sign-up through the following week.

<img alt="yarnball1.jpg" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/yarnball1.jpg" class="alignleft" />This week's featured swap is the [Magic Yarn Ball](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/1708) swap coordinated by [Katy](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4512). This is a great swap for people who would love to receive (and send!) yarn that could be used in knitting or crocheting projects. The swap is marked US only and has a few other restrictions, so please read the entire description before signing up. (Also, we just implemented a new feature which allows coordinators to check over the final list of participants and ban anyone they need to before partners are assigned, so make sure you meet all of the requirements.)

So, what exac

tly is a magic yarn ball? Katy describes them likes this:

> Basically, you wrap cool little treasures up in a ball of yarn, and give it as a gift. As the recipient crafts with the yarn the treasures fall out one by one, and they discover the fun as they knit or crochet.

There are all sort of little trinkets and treasures you could include in your magic yarn ball for your swap partner to discover, like buttons, candy, beads, little figurines, fabric, ribbon, toys, etc&#8230; Anything small and playful that your partner will be delighted to see unraveling from their ball of yarn
