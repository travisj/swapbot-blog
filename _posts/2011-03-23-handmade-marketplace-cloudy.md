It is grey and cloudy in my world today. (And sadly, there is no chance of meatballs for dinner. boo.) So, I thought I should just embrace it find some pretty, but rainy and cloudy Etsy picks, like the [beautiful watercolor painting by lauraprill](http://www.etsy.com/listing/70659997/storm-gathering-original-watercolor-on?ref=pr_shop) seen above.
