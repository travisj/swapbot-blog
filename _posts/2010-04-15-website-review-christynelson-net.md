[ChristyNelson.net](http://www.christynelson.net/) is an awesome craft blog I discovered during my work with the organizers of the upcoming [CraftyCon](http://craftycon.com/) event. Christy is one of the organizers of CraftyCon, one of the co-owners of [Toolulu](http://www.toolulu.com/), a social media marketing company, a mother of two, and she also manages to keep ChristyNelson.net updated constantly with great crafty content. In fact, she has been publishing the blog since December of 2008, posting everything from craft projects and tutorials to product reviews and gift guides.

Christy also hosts ingenious, monthly [Craft Challenges](http://www.christynelson.net/category/challenges/). The Challenges consist of a random group of secret craft supply items chosen by Christy each month. Participants sign up to receive a packet of these craft supplies in the mail for just $5. (They can be purchased in [Christy&#8217;s Etsy store](http://www.etsy.com/shop/christynelson).) When they receive the supplies, they make something awesome, submit photos of their creations, and compete for the chance to win prizes! Each month the supplies are totally different and you don&#8217;t know what they will be until they arrive at your door. The Challenges are a great motivator (or excuse) to get you crafting and trying new things. Christy provides the challenge, you provide the inspiration and crafting skill! 

This month, I received one of Christy&#8217;s Challenge packages. It consisted of some black felt, burlap, black sequins, safety pins, and my favorite, a black chiffon rose. I am already cooking up some great ideas for what I am going to make&#8230; check back at the end of the month to see my final craft creation.
