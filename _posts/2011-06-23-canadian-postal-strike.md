As many of you are already aware, the [Canadian postal system](http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/default.jsf) is currently shut down due to a strike. That means no mail is going in or out of the country. Operations officially shut down on the 14th. You can get more information about the strike [here](http://media.infopost.ca/en/archives/). 

Obviously, if the Canadian postal system is not running, swaps cannot be sent to and from that country. Hopefully, the strike will end soon, but for now: **Do not rate your partners down for late mailing caused by the strike.** 

Communicate with your partners if you&#8217;re swapping is affected by the strike and let me know (rachel -at- Swap-bot.com) if you have any questions or concerns.
