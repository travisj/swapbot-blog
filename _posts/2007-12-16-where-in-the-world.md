The [map](http://www.buddymapping.com/maps/swap-bot) 

<div style="display:none">
  <a href="http://utero.pe/?house_of_flying_daggers">House of Flying Daggers on dvd</a>
</div>

above was started by user, [kassrose](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=9869), on Buddymapping.com. It shows the location of all the Swap-bot users who have added themselves to the map. You can add yourself to it by visiting [BuddyMapping](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=9869) and clicking on the &#8220;Add yourself to the map&#8221; link in the bottom right of the screen. It is fun to see where everyone is located. We are excited that there are people from all over the world participating on Swap-bot! 

For comparison, here is the visitor map generated by our site statistics. It maps every traceable* location where someone has visited Swap-bot.com in the last thirty days. (We haven&#8217;t posted a user map like this since [May of 2006](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2006/05/09/visitors-from-around-the-globe/)

*Not every location is always mapped by our site statistics. If your area is not represented, add yourself to the BuddyMapping map asap!
