[Craftlog](http://craftlog.org/craftlog/) is an extensive blog that has been kept up for over five years. It is a simple website, but a great resource for sewing projects and many other crafts. The site&#8217;s categories range from Blythe dolls to crafty book and TV reviews to cross stitch and embroidery to paper crafts. There is also a major list of [crafty links](http://craftlog.org/craftlog/?page_id=2503) and a group of [crafty book reviews](http://craftlog.org/craftlog/?page_id=2521) . Craftlog is definitely a site you will want to bookmark for future reference!
