[FunnerKimberley](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:FunnerKimberley) has been hosting some awesome Ernie-themed swaps! Her most recent was the [Ernie the Envie Inspired Swap #2 &#8211; Halloween Themed](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/156913).

These two frighteningly awesome Ernie creations were made for the swap. Count Ernie von Envelope (seen above) was made in glass by [smadronia](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:smadronia). I love the little fangs!! And the FrankenErnie plushie (seen below) was made by [moonlightlaura](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:moonlightlaura). Look at that detail! So cute!

You know that I am in love with every amazing Ernie interpretation. If you&#8217;ve made or received one, please send me photos to rachel &#8211; at &#8211; swap-bot.com. And if you&#8217;d like to try your hand at an Ernie craft, check out FunnerKimberley&#8217;s upcoming swap: [Ernie the Envie Give Thanks and Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/161102). Fun!
