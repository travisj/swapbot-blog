[This is Your Life! &#8230; in Recipes](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/90733) is a unique, international swap hosted by [honeyblossom](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:honeyblossom). For the swap you answer questions about yourself by sharing some of your favorite recipes. Honeyblossom describes the requirements better than I, so here is the info from the swap page:

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

_For this swap you will be required to answer the questions listed below by using a recipe. You will also need to send a note with the recipes explaining your choices. You will have 2 partners, so each partner will get at least 3 recipes.

What recipes stirs up a memory from your childhood?
