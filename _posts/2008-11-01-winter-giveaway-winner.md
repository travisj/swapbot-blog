We have a winner! This morning I printed out all of the names from the comments that had been posted on the [Winter Prize Giveaway](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/10/24/winter-prize-giveaway-enter-to-win/) (we had a total of 85 unique entrants). Then, Travis covered his eyes and drew a random paper slip out of our Halloween candy bucket. AND&#8230; the winner of the Making Memories prize pack is [Onigiri885](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:OniGiri885)

  


! Congrats! This is her comment from the entry post:

I will be sending her an email confirming her win and then her package will be mailed next week. I hope she has fun with all those supplies! We are planning on creating a friends system in the near future (as well as a &#8220;block user&#8221; system), so it was a great suggestion, too. Actually, everyone had wonderful suggestions. Thank you all for your feedback! We hope to implement most of the ideas as quickly as possible. Although, knowing us it will probably take longer than we would like. Stay tuned for site improvements and many more giveaways on the blog! xoxo
