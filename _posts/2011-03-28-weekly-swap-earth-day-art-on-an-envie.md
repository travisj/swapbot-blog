This week&#8217;s featured swap is the [Earth Day Art on an Envie Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/85309) hosted by [greenraisin](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:greenraisin). 

From the swap description: 

_April 22 is [Earth Day](http://www.earthday.org/)! So let&#8217;s help celebrate this day by sharing Earth Day mail art with our fellow swap-botters.</p> 

Swap Requirements:

  1. Decorate an envelope with an Earth Day theme and create a coordinating card to go with it for your partner.
  2. Inside the card include at least one idea on how you like to help preserve and protect our mother Earth.

Your Earth Day mail art may be done in any medium and style preferred by you.</i>

The swap is international and you only have one partner. [Sign up before April 13th!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/85309)
