When you next log into Swap-bot, you may notice two new additions to the Dashboard.

First, we have added a drop down menu under the Dashboard link so that you can get to your different swap lists more quickly.

Second, we have created a new list within your Dashboard just for your hosted swaps. All of the current and previous swaps that you have hosted will be listed there. If you have not hosted any swaps, you will not have a &#8220;Hosting&#8221; Dashboard section. 

We still have a lot of work to do on the site navigation and organization, but this is one small step in the right direction! Enjoy!
