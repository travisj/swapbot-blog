Since Swap-bot is hosting the tonight and we are making Valentine-themed matchboxes, I thought it would be handy to feature some of the matchbox swaps that are currently open for sign up on the &#8216;bot. 

If you are visiting the Swap-bot blog via Etsy, hello & welcome! You can find the free matchbox templates we will be using at the Etsy Craft Night available for download . There is also a free matchbox enclosure card download available . Have fun making your matchboxes and be sure to check out these international matchbox swaps:

  * &#8211; sign up before February 4th.
  * &#8211; sign up before February 10th.
  * &#8211; sign up before February 14th.

You can always find more matchbox swaps on Swap-bot by going to the page and searching under the &#8220;Boxes&#8221; category. Happy swapping!
