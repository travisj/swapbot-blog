Back from a little blog break, and I have some awesome swappy goodness for you:

[  <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/minienvie.jpg" alt="minienvie" title="minienvie" width="470" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2106" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/carotte/3738821373/)

This amazingly small and adorable Ernie the Envie was created by Swap-bot user, [Carotte](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Carotte). She recently hosted a [Teeny Tiny Stuffie swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/40417) that asked the participants to create stuffies smaller than 2 inches. While working on her stuffie for the swap, she created this tiny [Ernie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/carotte/3738821373/). She says he is about 1 inch wide and can really work as a teeny tiny envelope for teeny tiny swap&#8230; you can even put a teeny tiny letter inside and close it. How cool is that?! I just adore him!
