Come join the best swap ever! (Ok, I may be a little biased since I am the one hosting this swap&#8230;) If you like making matchboxes, and you are looking forward to the winter holiday season, the [Christmas (fun) Time Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/8173) is perfect for you! The swap is international and it is open for signup through November 16th. Each participant has just one partner to whom they send one decorated and filled matchbox. The theme, of course, is the Christmas holiday, but any winter-type themes would also work. However, you must be open to receiving Christmas items in the mail. Each participant must have above a 4.6 rating to join. I am allowing a few new users, but they have all checked with me before joining. I will ban anyone who looks questionable. (BREAKING NEWS: I plan to make a good number of extra Christmas matchboxes and I will angel for this swap starting two weeks after the mail deadline. That should still give enough time for matchboxes to arrive before Christmas.)
