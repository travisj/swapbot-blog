Travis worked hard making a few improvements to the site this weekend. Here is what has been improved:

  * There is now a &#8220;games&#8221; category for swaps. You select up to three swap categories when creating each swap, and you can search by category on the &#8220;View all swaps&#8221; page.
  * The image uploading problem when editing newly created swaps should now be fixed. You should have no problem uploading .jpgs, .gifs, or .pngs to represent your swaps now.
  * The account self deletion option should now be working correctly. If you choose to delete your account (permanently) you can now click on the link at the very bottom of the &#8220;Edit Profile&#8221; page and, if you are not in any open swaps, your account will automatically be deleted. Previously this option had a few bugs. 

Please let us know if you notice any problems with these three improvements. Thanks!
