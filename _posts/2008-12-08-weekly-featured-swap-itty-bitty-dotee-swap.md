The [Itty Bitty Dotee Doll swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/25514) is a repeat of a previous version both hosted by [adoptacritter](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:adoptacritter). The swap is international with only one partner. Your dotee doll can be of any theme and color &#8212; the only requirement is that it must be tiny. The example in the photo is about 2.5 inches tall. You must have a 4.75 rating to enter. Sign up closes January 7th, and you must send by January 21st, 2009.
