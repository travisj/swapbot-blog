I know that not everyone loves Valentine&#8217;s Day &#8212; it can be too romantic, too gooey and sweet, too commercial &#8212; but I think it is a fun theme to craft around. Hearts are a universal motif that can mean many things. And so, this week I am featuring the [Give a Piece of Your Heart Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/109982) hosted by [KarlaKC](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KarlaKC).

For the **international** swap, you simply: &#8220;Create something for your partner that is a heart or that has a heart in it.&#8221; The heart item can be made with any medium and in any style. 

From the swap description:

_&#8220;As a crocheter and knitter, I might make a heart stuffie, a bookmark, a necklace, a purse, a scarf&#8230;anything that is or has a heart. If you enjoy sewing, you might make any of the above or have other ideas. Beaders, or jewelry makers, what would you make? Papercrafters, there are notecards, ATCs, journals, matchboxes, etc. that you might consider. Woodcrafters, what would you make? Everyone, what can you make that is or has a heart?&#8221;_

Last year, I made the yarn-wrapped heart seen above for a very similar swap. And look at the amazing [embroidered fabric heart](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/5435809223/in/set-72157602135475903) that I received from [beckarahn](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:beckarahn)! Wow! There are endless ways to interpret this swap!

The [Give a Piece of Your Heart Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/109982) is open to experienced swappers who have done ten Type 3 swaps and have a 4.9 rating, or higher. Sign up by January 23rd!
