I have been drawn to the cupcake-themed swaps I've seen around the 'bot lately, but I always feel like I need just a tiny bit more wiggle room on the theme&#8230;. so&#8230;.

I know it can be hard to find enough items of a specific theme to completely fill a matchbox, so there can be some freedom on what you include inside the matchbox. If some things simply follow a candy-coated color theme, that is fine by me. Just think delicious and cute!

If you want to create your matchbox from scratch, I have two free downloadable PDF templates that you can use [here](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/03/03/tuesday-tip-rachels-matchbox-template/) and [here](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/06/09/tues-tip-envelope-style-matchbox-template/). You can also view lots of examples of matchboxes on my [Flickr Swap-bot set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/sets/72157602135475903/).

The [Cute Dessert Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/38941) is international and all participants must have over a 4.8 rating with a strong swap record. Each swapper only has one partner and you must get signed up before July 4th. Come swap with me!!
