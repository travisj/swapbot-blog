Lot of fun finds this week &#8211; everything from Father&#8217;s Day to fun in the sun. Enjoy!

  * Time is getting short, but here are the Round-Ups of Father&#8217;s Day projects from [Craft:](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2009/06/fathers_day_gift_guide_on_make.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954) and [Make:](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/06/diy_for_dad_happy_fathers_day_from.html) magazines.
  * CraftyPod always has excellent crafty podcasts, but I especially like this week&#8217;s topic [&#8220;Why Do You Make Things?&#8221;](http://www.craftypod.com/2009/06/19/craftypod-94-why-do-you-make-things/) SIster Diane interviewed crafters at the Maker Faire and also reads some Twitter responses to the question. Twelve minutes of fun and inspiration!
  * Check out [CraftGossips&#8217;](http://craftgossip.com/) picks for the [Top Ten Craft Blogs](http://www.blogs.com/topten/craft-gossips-10-favorite-craft-blogs/index.html) on blogs.com. Do you agree with the picks? What are your picks for the top craft bogs?</li> 

Two new crafty resources that I just discovered: The Craft & Hobby Association&#8217;s new website, [craftplace.org](http://www.craftplace.org/) and [Craft Leftovers](http://www.craftleftovers.com/blog/), a fun and helpful blog with a companion print zine.</li> 

  * Lastly, two fun in the sun summer projects: [Floating Beverage Barge](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Beverage-Barge-MK-2/) from Instructables and [Summer Fruit Punch Bookmarks free download](http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/2009/06/freebies-summer-fruit-punch-bookmarks.html) from Jinjerup.</ul> 

Happy Father&#8217;s Day to all the dads!! xoxo
