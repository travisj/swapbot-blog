The [Holiday Donation Drive for the Partnership for the Homeless](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/10/19/donate-to-the-holiday-gift-drive/) is now over and I have some amazing totals to report!

**The numbers:**

  * 85 Swap-bot members donated something to this Holiday Gift Drive.
  * Nearly $600 was donated via Paypal, which I used to purchase 60 Target gift cards for $10 each.
  * Over $140 in additional gift cards, to places like Gap, Barnes & Noble, and Old Navy, were mailed in as donations.
  * 51 items of warm weather gear &#8212; like gloves, scarves, sweaters, hats, etc &#8212; were donated.

**I think this donation drive was an extreme success!!** Thank you so much to everyone who participated. I am taking all of the items to [The Partnership for the Homeless](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5) on Wednesday, and they are hosting their [Children&#8217;s Holiday Party](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/childrens-holiday-party) on Saturday. I am sure it will be a wonderful event!
