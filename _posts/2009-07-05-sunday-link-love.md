Once again, your links are running late this week. An [anniversary](http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=2116) and a national holiday got in the way&#8230; 

I hope everyone had a lovely weekend! Enjoy:

  * I just found out about [Zibbet.com](http://www.zibbet.com/). It is a handmade marketplace based in Australia. It is still in beta and I have not actually bought or sold anything on the site yet, so let us know if you have had any experience with Zibbet. 
  * [Check out this cool, wind-powered, vintage knitting machine.](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2009/07/wind-powered_knitting_machine.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954)
  * Whip Up recently published a nice [round-up of recycled and alternative yarn brands and resources](http://whipup.net/2009/07/02/recycled-alternative-yarn/) .
  * The Martha Stewart Weddings website recently released a whole new section dedicated to <a href=http://www.marthastewartweddings.com/templates-and-clip-art">DIY Weddings</a>. There are tons of free downloadable clip art and project ideas that would work great for all types of event, not just weddings. 
  * The newest issue of [MixTape zine](http://www.mixtapezine.bigcartel.com/product/mixtapezine-mixtapezie-issue-9-limited-edition-full-colour) (#9 in full color!) looks pretty fabulous. You can read a nice review of it on [CraftyPod](http://www.craftypod.com/2009/06/30/digging-the-new-mixtape/).
