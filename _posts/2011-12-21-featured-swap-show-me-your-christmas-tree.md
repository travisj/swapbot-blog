</div>-8700&#8243; /></a>Happy Winter Solstice, everyone! (It is tomorrow in the Northern Hemisphere.) And, Happy Hanukkah, too! (It started last night.) Christmas is just four days away and 2012 will be here in just a little over a week! Wow. So many holidays, so little time! All sorts of holidays are celebrated by Swap-bot members and holiday swaps are very popular! Sadly, the time for Christmas snail mail swaps is winding down&#8230;. BUT there is still time for some e-swaps! Like the [Show Me Your Christmas Tree Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/106956) hosted by [Schwallie](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Schwallie). For the **international** swap, you send each of your 10 partners a few pictures of your Christmas Tree and a few ornaments via email. You can also write a little about your tree and the significance of the ornaments you have chosen to share. What an easy and fun way to share your holiday traditions, while learning about lots of new ones in the process! **Sign up by December 26th!**Above is the Swap-bot HQ holiday tree from this year. It is just a mini potted tree, but I think it looks festive with the lights! Now I just need to make a little Ernie the Envie ornament&#8230;Whatever you celebrate this time of year, enjoy it!! Happy holidays!!
