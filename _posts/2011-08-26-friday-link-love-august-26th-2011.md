Those of us on the east coast of the US are prepping for Hurricane Irene this weekend (don&#8217;t worry, Travis, Crusher & I have lots of water, food, first aid, etc &#8212; we will stay safe), but I still managed to get you a great group of links this week. woohoo! 

  * Those adorable unicorn cookies seen above are from [The Decorated Cookie](http://www.thedecoratedcookieblog.com/2011/08/more-rainbows-and-unicorns-cookies-and.html).
  * You may have already seen this before, but it is too wacky not to share: [Creative dog grooming by Sandy Paws](http://www.pinkcoyote.net/creativegrooming.html). I like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle grooming style the best.
  * [A review of _The World&#8217;s Smallest Post Service_ craft kit on Craft Critique.](http://www.craftcritique.com/2011/08/vendor-spotlight-worlds-smallest-post.html)
  * And speaking of postal mail, did you know you can send real postcards featuring your Instagram photos straight from your phone with [Postagram](http://postagramapp.com/)? 
  * [How to make glittery Galaxy Play Dough.](http://fairydustteaching.blogspot.com/2011/05/galaxy-playdough.html)
  * More glitter: How to make [glitter tape](http://www.puglypixel.com/2011/06/28/stardust-part-1-diy-glitter-tape/) from Pugly Pixel.
  * A new-to-me craft blog: [Sew Country Chick](http://sewcountrychick.blogspot.com/).
  * So bizarre in the best way: [_CSI Miami_-themed cupcakes](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2011/08/csi_miami_cupcakes.html), complete with tiny crime scene decorations.
  * Too cool! [Han Solo in carbonite ice cube molds.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004R7S9I2/ref=nosim/0sil8) I love Han!
  * Be green this Halloween. October 8th is [National Costume Swap Day](http://www.greenhalloween.org/CostumeSwap/index.html).
  * And because it wouldn&#8217;t be a link love without an insane dessert recipe: [Cookies and Cream Brownie Cookies](http://www.bakersroyale.com/cookies/cookies-cream-brownie-cookies/).

Everybody be safe this weekend!
