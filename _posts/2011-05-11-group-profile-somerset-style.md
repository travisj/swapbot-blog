There are over 1200 groups to choose from on the &#8216;bot, so I am happy that user, [CarrieZee](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CarrieZee), brought one of the many great groups to my attention for this week&#8217;s group profile. 

Let me introduce you to [Somerset Style](http://www.swap-bot.com/group/dfbb6fbc5bb4e343d50ed11d65a76c6c/about)! The group hosts craft swaps inspired by the style popularized by the [Stampington Publications](http://www.stampington.com/magazines/), like [Somerset Life](http://www.stampington.com/somersetlife/), [Belle Amoire](http://www.stampington.com/bellearmoire/), [Apprentice](http://www.stampington.com/somersetapprentice/), [Green Craft](http://www.stampington.com/greencraft/), etc. The group was founded in October 2009 by [YooperHill](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:YooperHill) and [homeandheart](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:homeandheart).

Somerset Style swaps are of an exceptionally high quality. All group members must have completed at least ten craft swaps before joining the group, as well as have no 1 or recent 3 ratings. The swaps are all craft-related and often feature embellished paper crafts. Below is an upcycled wall pocket made by CarrieZee for a Somerset Style swap<a />: </p>
