I recently received a copy of the amazing &#8220;Going Postal Gallery,&#8221; a mail art zine created by Swap-bot member [TangleCrafts](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TangleCrafts), and I just had to share it with you&#8230;

[<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine1.jpg" alt="" title="goingpostalzine1" width="470" height="306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5664" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine1-300x195.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine1.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" />](http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine1.jpg)

From the zine&#8217;s cover description: &#8220;In January 2010 [TangleCrafts](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TangleCrafts) launched a new mail art project, inviting artists and crafters worldwide to submit a postal or mail art themed ATCs (an ATC is an Artist&#8217;s Trading Card &#8211; the only requirements for them being that they are only ever traded &#8211; never bought or sold &#8211; and that they each measure 2.5&#8243; x 3.5&#8243;). All contributions received a free copy of a mini-zine featuring their artwork in exchange. The project drew to a close on August 31st, 2010, and this zine-shaped &#8216;gallery&#8217; showcases all contributions received, plus notes on inspiration, techniques, and crafty habits from the artists. Enjoy!&#8221; 

For more information about the project, check out the [mail art section of TangleCraft&#8217;s blog](http://tanglecrafts.wordpress.com/mailart/going-postal/).

I can&#8217;t share all of the awesome ATCs included in the Going Postal zine, but here are a few examples&#8230;

[<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine2.jpg" alt="" title="goingpostalzine2" width="470" height="641" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5665" />](http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine2.jpg)

The top ATC is titled &#8220;My favourite time of the day: Special Delivery&#8221; and it was created by [oliviarrow](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:oliviarrow) using pen and watercolor.

The lower ATC by [farstarr](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:farstarr) was created with upcycled materials including a cancelled fish stamp, and is titled &#8220;Fish in the Mail Make my Heart Beat Faster.&#8221;

[<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine3.jpg" alt="" title="goingpostalzine3" width="470" height="629" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5666" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine3-224x300.jpg 224w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine3.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" />](http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/goingpostalzine3.jpg)

The top card here is actually an ACEO (Art Cards, Editions and Originals) created by [Hazel Fisher](http://www.etsy.com/shop/HazelFisherCreations?ref=seller_info). It is a gouache painting of a British postbox.

The bottom ATC is a moveable collage created by [TiaBel](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:T%C3%ADaBel) of Swap-bot. The flag can be moved and inside the tiny envelope is a personalized postmark.

All three of the ATCs seen above were created by [peony](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:peony). They are collages utilizing stamps, maps, envelopes, and other ephemera. I love the use of the airmail stripes!
