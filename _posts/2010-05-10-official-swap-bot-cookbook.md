What a great idea! Swap-bot member is organizing a Swap-bot cookbook with recipes submitted by Swap-bot users, and she needs your help! Blair&#8217;s (cbpoole) goal is to compile all of our favorite recipes from a wide variety of meal categories (sides, entrees, dessert, vegetarian, etc) and print them in a bound book. She is looking for many more recipes and all Swap-bot members are welcome to submit up to five recipes. 

You can submit your recipes to **swapbotcookbook@yahoo.com** . Please include the following information for each recipe:

  * Your first name and your Swap-Bot Username</il> 
      * The category your recipe falls under
      * Name of your recipe and the full recipe
      * Picture of your completed recipe (if possible)</il> </ul> 
        All of the recipes must be submitted by next **Monday, May 17th** !! You can learn more about the different recipe categories and the details of this project in . (Remember, you must be logged into Swap-bot to access the forums.)
        
        Once completed, the Swap-bot Cookbook will be for sale to any and all Swap-bot members. All proceeds from the sale of the cookbooks will be donated to Blair&#8217;s good friend, Swap-bot user cancer care. April (rainbowafterrain91) was very recently diagnosed with Lymphoma and is currently undergoing treatments. You can read more about her experiences on . 
        
        I am really excited about this Swap-bot Cookbook project and can&#8217;t wait to submit my own recipes! The fact that the book&#8217;s sale will help support a fellow Swap-bot user during a tough time just makes it even more amazing. Let&#8217;s make this an awesome cookbook!
