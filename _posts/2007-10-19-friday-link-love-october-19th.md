I&#8217;ve got some wild links for you this week:

  * Check out [Martha Stewart&#8217;s new attic craft room](http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/marthas-craft-room?lnc=1a89cf380e1dd010VgnVCM1000005b09a00aRCRD&rsc=lpg_home&currentslide=0&currentChapter=1&chapterCounter=1&lpgStart=1&adnumber=1#lpg). It is a little TOO organized for my taste&#8230; but I would take it.
  * [This to That](http://www.thistothat.com/) is a glue calculator. It tells you what type of glue you should use for different craft projects. (found via [Craft:blog](http://craftzine.com/blog/))
  * A hearty, healthy [fall cookie recipe](http://jessthomson.wordpress.com/2007/10/12/a-cookie-for-fall/) from [hogwash](http://jessthomson.wordpress.com/). (found via [not martha](http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2007/10/16/links-food-8/) )
  * This is crazy: a [Hello Kitty assault rifle](http://www.glamguns.com/hk47.html)! (found via [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/10/18/hello-kitty-assault.html))
  * [MindBites](http://www.mindbites.com/) is a new website where you can watch and share video tutorials on how to do almost anything! Most of the tutorials cost, but you can earn credits by adding your own lessons. (found via <a href=http://www.craftypod.com/">CraftyPod</a>)
