I haven't done much crafting lately, but I did find time to make the little matchbox you see above this week. (You can make your own using my [free matchbox template](http://blog.swap-bot.com/rachels-matchbox-template/)!) What crafting did you do this week?

**For your Friday afternoon, a few fun links:**

  * [Twenty one-afternoon craft ideas.](http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2013/07/20-one-afternoon-craft-ideas.html)
  * This [Wrap It Up Pinterest board](http://pinterest.com/smittenlove/wrap-it-up-/) has tons of great ideas that could be used for packing up swaps.
