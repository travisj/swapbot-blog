It is hard to believe, but I am still making my way through the hundreds of amazing postcards that Travis and I received for the [&#8220;Thank You Swap-bot&#8221; swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/118529) that happened in June. There are just so many wonderful notes and handmade postcards that I am taking my time going through them and thanking each sender. 

Above are postcards from [MissiveMaven](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MissiveMaven), [FarStarr](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:FarStarr), [LauraDiamong](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:lauradiamond), [KindledWhimsy](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KindledWhimsy), [angellarae](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:angellarae), and [mskadie](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mskadie). 

The kind notes about Swap-bot are very meaningful and appreciated. Running this website for more that seven years has been fun and rewarding, but it also entails dealing with 24-hour complaints and problems. It can be overwhelming&#8230; so knowing that there are many users who are enjoying the site keeps us motivated. Thank you so much for your support!

**And now, some fun links to enjoy this week:**
