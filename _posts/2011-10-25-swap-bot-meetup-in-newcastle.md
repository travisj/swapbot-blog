On October 8th 2011, four Swap-Bot members &#8212; [AndrewLips](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:andrewlips), [Kessie](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Kessie), [kittenred](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kittenred), and [paperbutterflywings](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:paperbutterflywings) &#8212; met up in Newcastle, England.

_&#8220;We all met at my house around midday. Everyone who came got 3 goodie bags **each** from each member, including Swap-Bot postcards, buttons and stickers kindly provided by [racheljohnson](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson).</p> 

Then we did 3 workshops:

I did a screen printing workshop, where we screen printed Ernie onto t-shirts and tote bags. They came out really nice. Paperbutterflywings did a workshop showing us how to make sock monsters which was incredibly cute and easy to do. After that Kessie did a workshop on bottle-cap pendants and bottle-cap magnets. Again, this was so simple, and came out looking so lovely. We all had a lot of fun doing those workshops. Then we had dinner together. Later in the evening we had a houseshow at my house, which was 5 acoustic singers playing by candle light, followed by an 80&#8217;s disco! The swap-bot members stayed at my house for the night.

I love the screen printed Ernie items they made!! It sounds like a fun and very creative day. Remember, I&#8217;d love to share photos and reports from any and all Swap-bot user meetups. Email me anytime at rachel -at- swap-bot.com.
