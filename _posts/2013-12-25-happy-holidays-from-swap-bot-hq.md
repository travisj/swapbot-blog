If you celebrate it today, Merry Christmas, Swap-botters! And no matter what you celebrate, I hope the end of your 2014 is filled with fun and family and peace. 

Travis and I are so thankful that you have each been a part of the Swap-bot community this year. xoxo

These are all of the Christmas cards we received this year hung on the door to Swap-bot headquarters (aka my office at home.) Some are from friends and family, but most of them are from Swap-bot members! Thank you so much. You all have made our holiday special. (And yes, I work with Captain Jean Luc Picard.)
