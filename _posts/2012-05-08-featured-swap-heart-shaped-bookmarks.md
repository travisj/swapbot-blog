</div>=&#8221;alignnone size-full wp-image-8963&#8243; /></a>This week&#8217;s featured swap is an easy, **international**, paper craft swap: [Heart Shaped Bookmarks](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/119765). The swap, hosted by [Noale](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Noale), was inspired by the bookmark tutorial on the lovely blog, [Craft & Creativity](http://craftandcreativity.com/blog/2011/10/22/dagens-pyssel-bokmarken-craft-of-the-day-bookmarks/). For the swap, you will have three (3) partners. You will send each partner two (2) heart shaped bookmarks (for a total of 6), that you have made and decorated using the blog tutorial. The [tutorial](http://craftandcreativity.com/blog/2011/10/22/dagens-pyssel-bokmarken-craft-of-the-day-bookmarks/) is in both Swedish and English and shows you how to make sweet, heart shaped, corner bookmarks. All international swappers with ten (10) completed Type 2 & 3 swaps and a rating over 4.97 are welcome to join. [Sign up before May 23rd!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/119765)
