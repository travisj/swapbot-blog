Whether you celebrate Easter (which is on April 12th this year) or just want to do something fun for spring, this fun, creative, international swap promises to be a good time. 

For the swap, you send your one partner a carton of one dozen plastic eggs. Each egg will contain a little surprise, like candy, charms, a little note from you, small note pads, ribbons, buttons, thimbles, lip gloss, magnets, etc&#8230; You can also decorate each egg and the carton if you like. Your package must be mailed by March 20th to ensure that each person receives their eggs by April 1st. They then open one egg a day up until Easter. 

The swap is open to new users with a full profile and you must sign up before March 16th. Make sure to read the [full swap description](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/29897) before signing up. There is also a [USA/Canada-only Easter Egg Eggstavaganza](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/29930). Happy spring & happy swapping!
