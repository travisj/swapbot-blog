[<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/picture-1.png" alt="" title="picture-1" width="197" height="49" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-428" />](http://imgfave.com/)[imgfave.com](http://imgfave.com/) is a simple website that I think you may find useful. It is basically a bookmarking site, like [delicious](http://delicious.com/) or [digg](http://digg.com/), but just for images. You create an imgfave account and then you can easily add any images you find on the web to your imgfave library with a handy web browser button. imgfave links to your favorite images and displays them in a clean and clear way. From the site description:

> _imgfave is an image bookmarking service that allows you to save all your favorite images from around the web in one convenient place. You can also subscribe to users you like to keep up to date on what they&#8217;re adding._ 

I think of it as something like a scrapbook or inspiration organizer. It is totally easy to use and although I just started using it, I think it will help me remember and keep track of the many beautiful things I come across on the internet each day. Check out my [imgfave profile](http://imgfave.com/index.php?action=showstream&nickname=racheljohnson) to see a few of my favorite images!
