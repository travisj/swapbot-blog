[The Purl Bee](http://www.purlbee.com/) is the online journal of [Purl](http://www.purlsoho.com/purl), &#8220;a shop devoted to beautiful materials and tools for knitting, sewing, quilting, and other crafts.&#8221; Usually, blogs connected to online stores are not extremely exciting &#8211; just a scattering of sale announcements or new product descriptions &#8211; but [The Purl Bee](http://www.purlbee.com/) is much different! It is a beautiful little blog full of project ideas, tutorials, articles, and absolutely beautiful photography. From the site description, &#8220;The Purl Bee is a resource for technical help as well as inspiration: you can rely on our illustrated tutorials and glossaries to help you navigate new crafts. Ask Purl Bee offers an in-depth response to common questions about materials and techniques from our readers and customers.&#8221;

If you are a fairly serious quilter or knitter, you will love the large number of knitting and patchwork projects. Less avid crafters will also find projects of interest, like this recent [Valentine Pin tutorial](http://www.purlbee.com/valentine-heart-pins/) . The instructions are very clear and simple, with photos to help you out all along the way. So sweet. </em>
