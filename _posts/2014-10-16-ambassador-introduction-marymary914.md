They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [marymary914](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:marymary914)!** Marymary914 lives in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan, and she has been a member of Swap-bot since 2008. Wow! She is a mom to two boys and two dogs, and she loves reading, stamping, and making ATCs!

**How marymary914 found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I&#8217;ve been on several book and postcard swapping sites for years, and thought I&#8217;d look up other types of swapping and found Swap-Bot! My life hasn&#8217;t been the same since.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I am a creative person (thanks, Mom, for encouraging creativity when I was young) and was looking for an outlet and a place I could learn new techniques from. I&#8217;ve been here since 2008! The members I swap with here are phenomenal and I aspire to their level of creativity on a daily basis. I tell people all the time about Swap-Bot and show them my art whenever I get the chance. And then I send it off to it&#8217;s new home with an awesome member from around the world.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;By far my favorite swap to do is a Type 3, usually ATCs. I&#8217;ve done mini books and bookmarks, but I always come back to my favorite ATC groups and 2-5 swaps per month of all ATCs. &#8221;

**Interesting facts about marymary914:** 

  * I&#8217;m a respiratory therapist, wife and mom.
  * I have over 500 books on my shelves (better get reading).
  * I&#8217;ll be married 14 years tomorrow (May 6th) to the guy I went to Senior Prom with!
  * I enjoy gardening with my oldest son. He knows as much about the plants as I do!
  * We have 2 rescue dogs (one from the Michigan Humane Society and one from the Dominican Republic).
  * We live about 5 miles from the Detroit city limits and no, that&#8217;s not scary like most people think. LOL 
  * I&#8217;m the oldest of 4 sisters and we are all pretty crafty. My one sister and I bake and decorate cakes for each others kids and each year they get fancier. [Here&#8217;s one I made for my niece.](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151424200862666&l=f6635c5f57)
