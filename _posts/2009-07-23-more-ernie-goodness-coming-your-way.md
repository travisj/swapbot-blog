This large and beautiful bag with a sweet Ernie the Envie softie charm was made by [Meitalt](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Meitalt) for her partner in the [I Love Swap-bot Handmade Item swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/39516), which she also hosted. The image on the right is a close-up of the hanging Ernie charm. Meitalt made the bag nice and large so that it can be used for taking swap packages to and from the post office. What an amazing handmade item for her lucky partner to receive!!

For the same swap, I ([racheljohnson](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson)) crocheted this portrait of Ernie for my partner. I had a lot of fun working on him and am happy with how cute he turned out despite my low level embroidery skills. 

_Ernie the Envie is the Swap-bot mascot/logo. I would love to post any handmade Ernie creations on the Swap-bot blog. Feel free to use any of the graphics on the [Stuff page](http://www.swap-bot.com/stuff.php) in your projects and email your finished photos to rachel [at ] swap-bot.com._
