I am running behind schedule this week, so this is a rare Saturday Link Love edition. Enjoy!

  * The image above is from a free tutorial offered by Heather Bailey for creating a [Mini Notebook](http://heatherbailey.typepad.com/heather_bailey/mininotebook.html). The PDF tutorial is worth downloading for the beautiful photography alone!
  * Omg! These [Secret Invites](http://www.twigandthistle.com/blog/2009/06/secret-invite/) seen on Twig & Thistle are brilliant!! I love the mini file folder!
  * [The Holocaust Museum in Houston is collecting 1.5 million paper butterflies to represent each of the children killed during the Holocaust.](http://www.hmh.org/minisite/butterfly/index.html) Anyone and everyone is welcome to send in a butterfly which will be included in the Spring 2012 exhibit. There are a few rules (like the butterflies must be 2D and not contain glitter) so make sure to read [The Butterfly Project](http://www.hmh.org/minisite/butterfly/index.html) site before sending in your butterfly.

  * Wanna see something cute and delicious? How about these [cupcake kebobs](http://cupcakestakethecake.blogspot.com/2009/06/more-kupcake-kebobs.html)!
  * [A free downloadable PDF project for the 4th of July from Elle's Studio.](http://ellesstudio.blogspot.com/2009/06/fun-4th-of-july-free-project-download.html)The PDF provides instructions and printables to create a cute banner to carry in a parade or stick in a potted plant as a holiday decoration.
  * I am pretty sure I am going to [Monday's Etsy Labs](http://www.etsy.com/storque/events/come-craft-with-the-etsy-labs-open-craft-night-4252/) here in Brooklyn. Give me a shout out if you are planning on attending the open craft night too!
