And I regret that I still have not introduced all of the awesome participants yet&#8230; but I will rectify that over the next few weeks with five more intro blog posts. The Ambassadors are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities. If you are interested in representing Swap-bot in your area and sending out Swap-bot swag, stay tuned for info about our upcoming second round of Ambassador applications._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [grimmlynn](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:grimmlynn)!** Grimmlynn lives near Birmingham, Alabama, and has been swapping on Swap-bot for more than six years. She loves crafting and has a pet Uromastyx (a type of lizard) and four cats.

**How grimmlynn found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I found Swap-bot while on [Craftster.org](http://www.craftster.org). Someone wanted to swap with me and suggested we &#8220;make it official&#8221; on Swap-bot, so I was introduced to your site and instantly fell in love with swapping. &#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I enjoy Swap-bot because it allows me to connect with other people, while at the same time expressing my creativity. In other words, I can make a new friend AND exchange something fun. It&#8217;s a wonderful way to inspire me to create, as well. I would not craft nearly as much if not for Swap-bot. It inspires me with new ideas, new techniques, and new materials.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;My favorite type of swap would probably be Inchies. I love making them and have been collecting them for a really long time. They are super fun to make and don&#8217;t really take up a lot of space to collect and can be displayed in really neat ways. I am also really into making matchboxes,which, by the way, are the perfect size for including a few inchies. I also like challenge type swaps, where you have to find certain things for your partner, vintage/thrift store swaps and really all types of swaps. I&#8217;ve never met a swap I didn&#8217;t like.&#8221; 

**Fun Facts about [grimmlynn](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:grimmlynn):**

  * &#8220;I recently gave my first rally speech to a crowd of over 100 people. It was the single hardest type of speaking I have ever done, but I would definitely do it again.&#8221; 
  * &#8220;I decided that I would give making an ATC a serious try for a swap because I liked the theme so much, so I made two Macbeth ones and loved the way they turned out. I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s the start of a new addiction!&#8221;
