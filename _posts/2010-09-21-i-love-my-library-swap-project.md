It is always exciting to see how our members utilize Swap-bot in unique ways! 

Swap-bot user, [Rainbowlicker](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Rainbowlicker), hosted a fantastic swap last month that combined postcard swapping with an appreciation project at her local library. In the [I Love My Library swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/69475), we each sent a postcard to our one partner describing why we love our local library. Then, we each ALSO sent a postcard with a similar sentiment to the Aurora Memorial Library in Ohio. Rainbowlicker is a librarian there and she used the postcards from the 60+ swap participants to create the display shown above. (Check out Ernie at the top! yay!) 

Here is her description of why she wanted to complete this project:

&#8220;As a librarian and avid reader, I do not know where I would be without mine. With the recent downturn in the economy libraries were hit especially hard so I think it is time to show them some love! &#8230;I want to show our children and patrons how much people from all over love their library!&#8221;

Libraries are such amazing community resources. (I used to work at my local library in high school and it helped me discover countless new books and authors.) I am thrilled that Swap-bot could help make this library appreciation project possible!
