I have few more fantastic Ernie the Envie (Swap-bot&#8217;s envelope logo mascot) craft creations to share&#8230;

This ATC (titled _Ernie Goes to Argentina_) and felt &#8220;fascinator&#8221; (which can be used as a brooch or decoration) were created by for the . I love how Ernie is on top of a pile of mail in each of the items. So cute and true to life! <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

For the same swap, I received this Ernie postcard and Swap-bot-themed matchbox from :

The matchbox is displayed in a place of prominence at Swap-bot HQ! 

The following items were not made for a specific swap, but instead were created by VJP to include as little extras in her swap packages. They are the most amazing Ernie and Evie themed charms. (Evie is Ernie&#8217;s new pink girlfriend created by .) I really like how the charms are coated in a clear epoxy &#8211; very fancy!

Thank you to everyone who has shared their Swap-bot-themed creations. I am always looking for more to include here on the blog. If you have a craft to share, please email me at rachel [at] swap-bot.com with your photos!
