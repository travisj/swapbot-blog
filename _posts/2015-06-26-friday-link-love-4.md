Hello fun Friday friends! Take a peek at these cool links&#8230;

  * I&#8217;ve never actually made soap, but this [DIY Stained Glass Soap](http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2015/06/diy-stained-glass-soap.html) is so pretty it tempts me to try.
  * It is maybe a wacky craft project, but this [Flip Flop Summer Pool Noodle Wreath](http://foxhollowcottage.com/2012/06/flip-flop-summer-pool-noodle-wreath.html) would be fun summer decor.
  * Have you seen these [Toilet Paper Roll Mini Scrapbook Albums](http://www.making-mini-scrapbooks.com/toiletpaperminialbum.html)?! What a great use of repurposing! See also [Toilet Paper Mini Album video tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-jPLEytZr0) (There are [lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv_T9yXY_qM) of [different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAI55q8DqSM) [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD7Ueog3Ql4) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scTfrEE59vE) for [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owxb1Olc4WU) on YouTube. They would be fun to swap!)
  * An easy, fun, fairly nutritious treat for summer: [Kool Aid Yogurt Pops](http://www.inkatrinaskitchen.com/kool-aid-yogurt-pops-and-zoku-giveaway/).
  * I absolutely love these simple, but fun [USPS &#8220;From Me to You&#8221; stamps](https://store.usps.com/store/browse/uspsProductDetailMultiSkuDropDown.jsp?categoryNav=false&navAction=push&navCount=0&productId=S_473004&categoryId=buy-stamps)!
  * This is slightly off-topic, but if you enjoy history, this is my all-time favorite podcast: [Bowery Boys.](http://www.boweryboyshistory.com) (I listen while crafting and running!)
  * S&#8217;mores of the week: [S&#8217;mores Skillet Cookie](http://bethcakes.com/smores-skillet-cookie/) & [S&#8217;mores Lasagna](http://beyondfrosting.com/2014/07/21/smores-lasagna/). (I&#8217;m currently in the middle of a no-sugar food challenge, so S&#8217;mores research is painful this week!!)

What else are you loving on the vast world wide web this week??

_(ps. Did you hear the [good news](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html?smid=tw-bna&_r=0)? Who wants to host a Love-themed ATC swap?? I&#8217;m already working on [mine](https://instagram.com/p/4ZWxunC0C7/)!)_
