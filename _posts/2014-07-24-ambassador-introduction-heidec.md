They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**Say hello to our next Ambassador, [HeideC](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:heidec)!** HeideC is an **Original Member**, which means she has been on Swap-bot since before June, 2007. Awesome!

**Check out [HeideC&#8217;s Flickr photos!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/heidec/)** (She has lots of swap and craft photos!)

**How HeideC found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I think I originally found Swap-bot when I was trying to get some information about ATCs. When I googled ATC some flickr pictures came up and they referred to Swap-bot. The rest, as they say, is history!&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I love Swap-bot for its diversity and its acceptance of inexperience! When I look back on some of the ATCs, I have made I cringe a little&#8230;the first ones were very rough! I still remember the first ATC I made that I felt so very proud of _(seen below)_. It&#8217;s still on my flickr account as my favorite ATC. And having the advice of more experienced artists really helps. Swap-bot gave me the courage to make my first quilt&#8230;something I never thought I could do. Now I get people at work asking me to make quilts for them; its quite a boost to my self-esteem!&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;My favorite type of swap at the moment is ATCs, but I am also having fun in the Thriftstore Find group, its really a challenge to find something your partner will like that also fits the swap theme. As an example, the February theme was &#8220;red&#8221;&#8230; I found a tin that had previously held red scottie dog shaped licorice, filled it with other red goodies, taped it shut and mailed it naked&#8230; the Post Office ladies loved that one!&#8221; 

**Interesting facts about HeideC:** &#8220;I love yard sales and go to the flea market every Wednesday morning. I love to read and read 3-4 books a week. My favorite flowers are lilacs, lilly of the valley and lavender.&#8221;
