Your friendly peeps at Swap-bot headquarters are working on something special &#8212; we are planning a member appreciation event in Eugene, Oregon, on Sunday, March 1st, 2009. We thought it would be fun to meet fellow swappers in person. Plus, we wanted to do a Pacific NW event before Swap-bot headquarters makes its move to New York City in March. 

All Swap-bot members are invited, but we realize that it is probably only feasible for local NW swappers to attend. We are currently planning on a three-hour, meet-up event during the afternoon that will include ATC trades, craft demos and displays, door prizes, delicious snacks, and lots of time for chatting and hanging out. However, we need to get an idea of how many people might attend before we can finalize any of the plans. Please complete the poll below and let us know if you can attend:
