I haven&#8217;t featured a Dotee Doll swap in a while and this one sounds especially fun&#8230; the [Vegas Showgirl Dotee Doll Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/95474) hosted by [user8179](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:user8179).

From the swap description:

_&#8220;For this swap you will have one partner who you will be making a showgirl dotee. So think Vegas!!! Think feathers!!!! Colors!!! What ever says Showgirl to you.</p> 

What is a dotee? A dotee is a small art doll, 3&#8243; &#8211; 5&#8221; tall. Dotees also have a loop for hanging. Tails are optional.</i>&#8221;

The **international** swap is open for sign up until the end of the month, July 31st, and all users with a 4.85 rating, or higher, are welcome to join. 

(If you are a dotee lover, also check out this cool [Dotee Making Kit Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/95546) hosted by [charophyta](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:charophyta).)

If you are new to Dotee Dolls, here is a little more info:

Dotee Dolls are small fabric dolls created by Dorothy &#8220;Dot&#8221; Christian. They are meant to spread friendship, love, and joy.
