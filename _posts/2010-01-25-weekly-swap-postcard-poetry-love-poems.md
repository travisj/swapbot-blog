For a little inspiration, here is a classic love poem:

How Do I Love Thee?
  
by Elizabeth Barrett Browning

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
  
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
  
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
  
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.

I love thee to the level of everyday&#8217;s
  
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
  
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
  
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. 

I love thee with the passion put to use
  
In my old griefs, and with my childhood&#8217;s faith.
  
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
  
With my lost saints, I love thee with the breath,
  
Smiles, tears, of all my life! and, if God choose,
  
I shall but love thee better after death.
