**Breaking news:** As of this week, over 100,000 swaps have been hosted on Swap-bot! Wow!

[Travis](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj) & [I](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson) (and [Crusher](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:crusher)) have been running Swap-bot for almost six years and we never would have thought that so many swaps could have been hosted on our fun, little website. To celebrate this 100,000th swap milestone, I&#8217;m hosting a Swap-bot-themed mail swap &#8212; **[the 100,000 Swap!!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/100000)**

Everyone is welcome to join this easy swap. Each person will have one partner to whom they will send one piece of Swap-bot-themed snail mail. It can be a postcard, a letter, an ATC, an inchie, anything! The only strict requirement is that your item go through the postal mail and that it has some sort of Swap-bot decoration on it. 

Let&#8217;s see how many Swap-bot creations we can send all over the world!
