Welcome back to the handmade marketplace feature! I have missed picking my faves from [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com)! 

Tonight, I&#8217;m going to my first ever Yankees game, so I thought that it would be fun to search for handmade baseball items. The [necklace](http://www.etsy.com/listing/62478955/baseball-pendant-and-necklace-made-from?ga_search_query=baseball&ga_search_type=user_shop_ttt_id_5273897) seen above from the [qacreate shop](http://www.etsy.com/shop/qacreate?ref=seller_info) is made with a real baseball- cool!

Baseball makes it feel like summer! Plus, if your dad likes baseball, some of these items might make a good Father&#8217;s Day gift! The holiday is coming up on June 19th for those of us in the US, Canada, and the UK.
