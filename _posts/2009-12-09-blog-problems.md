Hey All,

I wanted to write a quick post explaining what happened here on the blog today. At some point during the day the company where we host our blog was hacked and all the customer passwords were stolen. The person who stole the passwords then logged in to many accounts and put files all over the place saying that the site was hacked. The problem still isn&#8217;t resolved and I am not getting very much information from our host, but if you would like to read more about the problem check out . I have pieced this blog back together the best I can tonight. The only thing that is really missing is the custom Swap-bot theme. Rachel and I will work on getting this back tomorrow.

I want to make sure that it is very clear that the site that was hacked was only the blog. Swap-bot, itself, is hosted on completely different servers in a completely different datacenter with a completely different company. The hacker that broke into the blog only had access to our blog posts, comments (which are all public already) and files. Personal data, such as your address and partners, was not compromised at all. This is very important and I want to make sure it is clear, so I will state it again. **Your personal Swap-bot data was not compromised at all.** 

Now that the blog is back, make sure to sign up for the latest giveaway!

Thanks,
  
Travis
