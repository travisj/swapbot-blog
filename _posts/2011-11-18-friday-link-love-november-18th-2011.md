Just a handful of links for you this week&#8230;

  * First off, did you know there was a book that can teach you how to [Knit Your Own Royal Wedding](http://whipup.net/2011/11/17/books-small-things-of-yarn/)?! The craft world is an amazing place.
  * Also, please enjoy this knitted [Gnomes vs. Snowmen art exhibit](https://www.galleryhanahou.com/exhibitions/current-show/).
  * I had [100 balloons](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/5441677965/in/set-72157625892772307) at my 30th birthday, but it wasn't quite as cool as this [surprise balloon birthday party](http://www.edytaszyszlo.com/blog/2011/10/02/diy-leahs-surprise-30th-balloon-birthday-party/). I especially love the invitations.

  * How would you like to experience Thanksgiving in one bite? I am intrigued. I may have to try making these [Thanksgiving Plate Cakelettes](http://fetetteblog.com/2011/recipe-thanksgiving-plate-cakelettes/). They are a full holiday meal taste sensation in cupcake form! And to use up the left over turkey, how about these [Turkey, Cheddar, and Apple Hand Pies](http://www.etsy.com/blog/en/2011/turkey-cheddar-and-apple-hand-pies/).
  * And for dessert? I would love one of these [Peppermint Mocha Cupcakes](http://www.bakersroyale.com/cupcakes/peppermint-mocha-cupcakes/) from Bakers Royale (seen above) or one of these [Baked S'mores](http://handmadecuties.blogspot.com/2010/08/baked-s.html).

**USA swappers, what are you making for Thanksgiving?**
