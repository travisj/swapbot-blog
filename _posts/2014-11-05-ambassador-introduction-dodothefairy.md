They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**How dodothefairy found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I really don&#8217;t remember how I found Swap-bot, but I liked it very quickly because it let me meet some amazing people and facts of the word.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I love receiving snail-mail, every parcel is a great joy.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;I try to spend not very much, so I really love the electronic swaps in which we could exchange photos of our city and life. I love also the profile surprise swap and escepially the ones in which you have to send a decorated envelope with a little surprise. I love to send coloful envelope drawn by me!&#8221;

**Interesting fact about dodothefairy:** &#8220;I love rain in summer. When last summer it began to rain I went under the raindrops and started dance and laugh!&#8221;
