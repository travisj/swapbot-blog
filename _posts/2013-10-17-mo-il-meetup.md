_On Saturday, October 12, 2013, six Swap-Bot members got together at the Foundry Artist Centre, in St. Charles, MO. The members were from different parts of Illinois and Missouri, and had never met in person before this fun-filled event! Each member had their own type of swaps they enjoy participating in and looking at the crafting area, they brought lots of goodies to share and work on!</p> 

Terri McHugh was showing everyone how to make lovely fondant flowers. Linda Bishop brought tons of crafting supplies to share. Ellie Patterson had lovely goodie bags and techniques to share. Tonya Bentley, Rachel Kaye, and Vicky Englert also had fun sharing and learning! What a great group of gals!

The time at the Foundry went way too quickly and everyone agreed that we should try to do this again! Also a big Swap-Bot Thank You to Rachel Johnson for the Swap-Bot swag – everyone loved it and will think of this fun day when they use their goodies!</i>

It looks like a fun event&#8230; I would love to learn how to make fondant flowers someday!
