Owls jumped in my head this week as I was browsing [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/) looking for cute finds. Owls have been popular for a while, so there is a lot to choose from, but I have not grown tired of their cute owly faces! (The notecard set above is from one of my favorite artists, [boygirlparty](http://www.etsy.com/shop/boygirlparty?ref=seller_info), on Etsy.)

What do you think? Do you love owls or are they over-played?
