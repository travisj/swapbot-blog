You will probably notice in the next little while that we have disabled the ability to color your display names. We have also disabled the ability to use HTML to change the format of your text and profiles. For security reasons we can no longer allow the use of HTML for formatting on the site. Any HTML used in your profile pages, swap pages, or in the forums will no longer work.

I know that everyone was LOVING the name colors, and that many of you had very beautiful and creative profiles. You can still use Markdown to format text on the site. We also hope to have a more systematic way of spiffing up your profile page soon. (With the option for background images and everything!) We will even add in an option for changing the color of your profile name. We just cannot allow the use of HTML at this time. You may have to adjust some of the content on your profile pages. I am sorry for this inconvenience.

I am very sorry for this disappointment. We will try to implement the profile decorating options as soon as possible.

**TIP:**

You can still put some images on your profile if you would like (although too many images may load very slowly and be distracting). Here is the Markdown code for linking to images &#8211;

\`!\[image title\](URL of image you want to link to)\`

It must have the exclamation point first, followed by the image title in brackets, followed by the image link in parenthesis. Good luck!
