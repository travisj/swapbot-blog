After a 2.5 month hiatus, weekly featured swaps are back! There are so many great swaps to choose from (577 open swaps right now!) it was hard to pick just one&#8230;

This week's featured swap is the [Fiber Art Photography ATC Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/5970) hosted by <a href=http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=9056">fiberfool</a>. The swap is open for signup through the end of August, and your ATCs must be mailed to your three partners by September 14th. The swap is international and open to any swapper with a 4.5 rating or higher. Each participant will send three ATCs to each of their partners. <img class="alignright" src=&#

ATCs are a very popular swap item, but despite their popularity I still get many emails asking what they are. ATCs are Artist Trading Cards. They are 2.5 x 3.5 inches in size, are created by hand, and are either one-of-a-kind or in limited editions. For those of you who are new to them, here are a few links to ATC sites:
