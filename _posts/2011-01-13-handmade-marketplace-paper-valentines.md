You already know that I like Valentine&#8217;s Day. I blame my love of the holiday on the fact that my birthday is just four days earlier. I&#8217;ve always loved sending and receiving valentines, so this week I&#8217;ve picked a bunch of lovely paper cards (like the beautiful one above from [Atellier22](http://www.etsy.com/listing/65856557/heart-and-doves-card-gocco-screen?ref=sr_gallery_38&ga_search_query=valentine+card&ga_search_type=handmade&ga_page=8&order=&includes%5B0%5D=tags&includes%5B1%5D=title&filter%5B0%5D=handmade)) that can be sent in February or anytime you want to send some love!
