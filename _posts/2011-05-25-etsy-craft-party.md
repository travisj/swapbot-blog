Etsy is hosting a global [Craft Party](http://www.etsy.com/storque/events/throw-an-etsy-craft-party-in-your-town-12650/) on Friday, June 10th, and you can be a part of it! You can join a party in your town or host your own:

_&#8220;Last year, over 5,000 people participated in over 500 meetups from Dallas to Romania, and this year our goal is for over 15,000 people to share in the spirit of Craft Party. Since we can&#8217;t do this without you, we&#8217;re calling on your help to mobilize in your local community. To participate, either as a local Craft Party organizer or party-goer, head on over to [Meetup Everywhere](http://www.meetup.com/etsy/).&#8221;_

Etsy Craft Party is a global initiative to energize local communities, make art together, and throw parties to celebrate creativity in cities and towns across the whole world. Everyone is invited to participate and Etsy will provide downloadable party kits for all of the Craft Party hosts.
