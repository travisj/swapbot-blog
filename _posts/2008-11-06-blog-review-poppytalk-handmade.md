_&#8220;poppytalk is a canadian design blog collecting inspiration and promoting emerging design talent.&#8221;_ 

I found [PoppyTalk](http://www.poppytalk.blogspot.com/) about two years ago when I was researching indie crafters. It is an extremely high-quality, professional blog that features arts, crafts, and handmade beauty. The blog has evolved to cover higher-end fine art and craft with beautiful, inspirational images in every post. The best parts of PoppyTalk are the reoccurring topics and guides, like the Interviews, Handmade Guides, [Free Downloads](http://poppytalk.blogspot.com/search/label/poppytalk%20download) , and Canada City Guides. The site has an extensive link list of design and craft blogs, and you can sign up for a PoppyTalk newsletter. There is also a [PoppyTalk Handmade Marketplace](http://poppytalk.blogspot.com/search/label/poppytalk%20download). It is a bit like etsy, except that the items have been curated by the PoppyTalk editors, so you never have to wade through mediocre products trying to find extraordinary handmade goods and design. There is so much great stuff in the Marketplace it is almost overwhelming! If you have ever thought about making a career out of your art or craft, PoppyTalk is a great place to go to get inspiration and info.
