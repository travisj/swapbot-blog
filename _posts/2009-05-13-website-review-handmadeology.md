I know that many of you not only create handmade items to swap, but you also sell them (or want to sell them) on sites like [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/) and [ArtFire](http://www.artfire.com/). If you need help navigating the world of selling handmade goods online, [Handmadeology](http://www.handmadeology.biz/home/) is helpful resource you should check out. From the site&#8217;s description:

_Handmadeology exists for the purpose of teaching artists how to successfully sell their handmade goods online. Through articles, blogs, video and screen shot tutorials, and Q & A dialogue between Timothy Adam and followers of his work, the formula for selling handmade goods online can be learned._ 

[Timothy](http://timothyadamdesigns.com/) has had success selling on [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5074716) since 2007 and also has a [blog](http://timothyadamdesigns.blogspot.com/) and an [Artfire store](http://www.artfire.com/users/timothyadamdesigns) . Selling his handmade metal jewelry, sculpture, and furniture online is his full-time job. On Handmadeology he shares his secrets for success. There are both articles and videos that can help beginners navigate the world of online selling, and help established sellers get more traffic to their store. You can learn more about Timothy and Handmadeology from his [CraftCast interview](http://www.craftcast.com/main/?p=433). </div>
