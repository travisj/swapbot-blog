More links to fun, crafty, cool things I found around the internet this week:

  * Easy-to-make [&#8220;Indie Foxx Garland&#8221; tutorial and template](http://indiefixx.com/2009/08/04/shes-crafty-indie-foxx-garland/) from Indie Fixx. 
  * Instructables and Singer are hosting a [Kids Craft Contest](http://www.instructables.com/contest/kidscrafts/). To enter, you must create an Instructable tutorial that explains how to make a kid-friendly craft project, involves some sewing, either by hand or machine, and be made with, by, or for a kid. You must enter before September 13th, and winners will be announced at the end of September. There are many prizes, but the grand prize winner will receive a professional Singer serger.
  * I like these [10 Everyday Tips to Change the World](http://www.etsy.com/storque/craftivism/10-everyday-tips-to-change-the-world-4568/) from Etsy&#8217;s The Storque.
  * [Handmade Romance](http://handmaderomance.blogspot.com/search/label/softie) has a ton of detailed information about how to design and create softies (aka stuffed animals and characters).
  * [Learn how to make your own sidewalk chalk on Mad Maggie Designs.](http://madmaggiedesigns.blogspot.com/2009/04/homemade-sidewalk-chalk.html)
  * The independent craft resource website, [Craftbits.com](http://www.craftbits.com/), just got a make over! The site is a great place to find tons of craft projects.
  * Just for laughs: [theoatmeal.com](http://theoatmeal.com/) (but beware, it may be a little offensive).
