They are all enthusiastic, fun, active Swap-bot members who all have 5.0 ratings and who have all been members for more than a year. They are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities and to be active, positive members of the â€˜bot._

**Say hello to our first Ambassador, [mariadastrouxas](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mariadastrouxas)!**

**Ambassador Region:** Portugal

**Her packaging design Pinterest portfolio:** [www.anaisabelmorais.com](http://www.pinterest.com/anaisabelmorais/)

On that website I contacted a portuguese swapper and she recommended the Swap-bot forum. When I checked it out, I never let it go.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;It&#8217;s so much fun. It&#8217;s such as a fantastic feeling when you receive a package from someone you don&#8217;t know physically but they spent their time to send you items you may like. It&#8217;s wonderful. I learned so many things about cultures from around the world, without traveling. It&#8217;s beautiful and true!&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;I prefer private Type 3 swaps (food, toiletries and stationary), usually large packages decorated with different postage stamps and calligraphies (mail art packages). For private swaps I can choose partners with a profile like mine so it&#8217;s more personal than public ones.&#8221; 

_Note from Rachel: mariadastrouxas is an amazing mail artist! Her packages are incredibly detailed and colorful, and she packages everything in ingenious ways! I have been very lucky to receive two of her beautiful packages in the past, including the one seen below._

**Interesting facts about mariadastrouxas:** &#8220;Before I found swap-bot, when I was a child, I remember a School Program, an exchange connecting my (Portuguese) school and an international school. Some children swapped a shoe box with cute things and supplies we didn&#8217;t have in Portugal. I wasn&#8217;t selected to be a part of that experience, but I never forgot it because I would have loved to be in that program.&#8221;

&#8220;In middle school, my english school teacher told me about a Penpalling Program. The whole class wrote letters to English children, but i never received a reply. I was a kid and felt so sad about not receiving any response. Much later I registered on Flickr (maybe 2003), made a profile, and did some swaps with Brazilian crafters. The packages from Brazil took a long time to arrive, one year at least!&#8221;

&#8220;When I went to university I forget the feeling of receiving snail mail because the lessons took so much time and effort, and I had to move from my home to study, so it was difficult to manage the mail in other addresses. After I started working I finally had more money and I registered on a [Portuguese forum](http://tralhasgratis.forumeiros.com) for free mail stuff and I received so much cool snail mail, like coupons and cinema tickets, but it was only suitable for Portuguese people and not so creative.&#8221;

&#8220;When i meet swap-bot, my life changed! There are so much creative persons and different cultures. I hope to continue swapping for my entire life!&#8221;
