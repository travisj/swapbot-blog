</div></a>This week&#8217;s featured swap is a creative craft project that will help you get ready for back-to-school time. It is the [Altered School Notebook Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/41081) hosted by [sewcrazy](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sewcrafty). For the swap, you purchase a blank school notebook and alter the cover according to your partner&#8217;s preferences. You can request that your partner create a notebook for your child who is heading back to school, or one for yourself. Make sure to post your preference in the swap&#8217;s comment section after signing up! The completed notebooks could be used for homework or as a journal or sketchbook. The swap is international and it is open for sign up through the end of July. To join in you must have already completed at least five mail swaps and received five 5 ratings. Have fun decorating those notebooks!
