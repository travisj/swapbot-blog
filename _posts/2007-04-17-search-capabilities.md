Most of you have probably already figured this out, but we just created a new swap search menu. If you go to the [&#8220;View all swaps&#8221;](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/search.php) <strong style="display:none"><a href="http://funwish.net/?fatal_blade">Fatal Blade the movie</a></strong> page, there are now a bunch of new options at the top of the page that you can use to find swaps. You can still browse the swaps by category, but now you can also sort the list by creation date, sign up date, and mail date. The best part is that you can now use the search box in the top right to type in words to find swaps. Try it out.

We also added a little box on the far right that shows how many swaps meet your search criteria. Right now there are a total of 335 swaps to search! wow!

Have fun. Let us know how the new searching works out.
