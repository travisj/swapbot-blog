The internet feels a bit quiet lately. Maybe everyone is out soaking up the last bit of summer or preparing for school to start. Whatever the reason for the lull, it means that I couldn&#8217;t round up as many links for you this week as I&#8217;d like &#8212; sadness &#8212; but here are a bunch of edible goodies&#8230; Enjoy! 

  * Don&#8217;t those black forest pancakes seen above look divine?! Get the [recipe from The Healthy Foodie](http://thehealthyfoodie.net/2011/08/08/black-forest-pancake/).
  * These [Chocolate Marshmallow Cookies](http://www.nobiggie.net/2011/08/chocolate-marshmallow-cookies.html) look delicious.
  * Heaven may be a [doughnut ice cream sandwich](http://www.jeffgreenhouse.com/2011/08/10/heaven-is-a-doughnut-ice-cream-sandwich/).
  * Summer yum: [Mojito Bars](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/mojito-bars/4eedc61c-17b4-4ddb-a420-19556d6da868?sr=2&st=7#/) recipe from Betty Crocker.
  * A very cool [space shuttle cake](http://fifer.phanfare.com/4651478_5139345) with an ice cream fuel tank and chocolate/caramel rocket boosters &#8211; wow!
  * And to justify it all: [How Chocolate Can Help Your Workout](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/how-chocolate-can-help-your-workout/).

I apologize if I made you hungry for sweets&#8230;
