It is the last day of July and I have a big ol&#8217; list of fun links for you! Everything from sewing patterns to crazy sandwiches. Enjoy!

  * A free detailed sewing pattern for the most adorable [toddler market skirt](http://www.dana-made-it.com/2008/07/tutorial-market-skirt.html) is available on the [Dana Made It blog](http://www.dana-made-it.com/). (via [Craft:](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2009/07/how-to_make_toddler_market_ski.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954))
  * Ever wanted to scrapbook the photos you have on your iPhone? Soon you will be able to with a new scrapbooking iPhone App called [Coolibah](http://blog.coolibah.me/2009/07/moving-right-along.html)!
  * I just discovered [iDIY](http://www.i-do-it-yourself.com/) . It is a site all about Do It Yourself weddings, but the free printable downloads offered on the blog (like these [labels](http://www.i-do-it-yourself.com/2009/07/free-vintage-apothecary-style-labels/), and these [notecards](http://www.i-do-it-yourself.com/2009/07/free-printable-personal-notecards-parsiri/)) are awesome and would be great for lots of projects.
  * Travis found this little gem: [knitted cozies for plastic lawn chairs](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ny/inspiration/knitted-chairs-crafted-cozies-for-plastic-chairs-091197) &#8211; crazy, but cute!
  * There is an easy sewing pattern and tutorial for making a [Tool Apron](http://www.etsy.com/storque/how-to/how-tuesday-tool-apron-from-sew-what-bags-4498/) on the the Etsy Storque. It was created by the author of [_Sew What! Bags_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603420924?ie=UTF8&tag=etsy-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1603420924), Lexie Barnes. 
  * These [AmiDogs patterns](http://planetjune.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=11_22&products_id=65) for sale on Planet June are so adorable! (They are original crochet amigurumi dog patterns by June Gilbank.) I think the Boston Terrier looks like [Crusher](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Crusher).
  * For all of you digital designers out there, this [Color Palette Generator](http://www.degraeve.com/color-palette/) is pretty sweet. You simply choose a photo from anywhere on the web and it creates a palette from the colors in the image. (via [Creature Comforts](http://creaturecomforts.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/07/web-help-color-palette-generator.html))
  * Ok, this is just for giggles (or gross outs) &#8211; check out the crazy sandwiches on [Insanewiches.com](http://www.insanewiches.com/). The [Rubix Cubewich](http://www.insanewiches.com/?p=808) might be the best one&#8230;

Now for two little self-promoting items:

  * This is most definitely going to be the featured swap next week, but I wanted to give it a shout-out early: [The Ernie the Envie craft swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/41830) (hosted by [MyAliceFair](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MyAliceFair). Ernie is the Swap-bot logo/mascot. Sign up for the swap to create Swap-bot-themed crafts for your partner&#8230; I want to post all of the adorable creations here on the blog!
  * My friend, Jennifer (of [Piddleloop](http://www.piddleloop.com/blog) fame), and I have started a fun, new Flickr group: [Mugshot Thursdays](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1184846@N22/). We take a PhotoBooth photo of ourselves every Thursday with our coffee mug (or tea mug&#8230; or milk mug&#8230; any mug) and add it to the photo pool. There are ten people currently in the group, but everyone is welcome to join in on the fun. Come show off your mug collection and your lovely face!
