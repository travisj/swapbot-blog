This week I have chosen the](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/7929)

<em style="display:none"><a href="http://www.turtlesurvival.org/?barbie_as_the_princess_and_the_pauper">Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper film</a></em> coordinated by [LOLA](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2910). Her description of the swap is very clear:

> Do you have a favorite Thanksgiving recipe or recipes that were handed down from your Family? How about new Family recipes that you make every Thanksgiving? Maybe there are new recipes that you have tried and decided they are going to be featured at the Thanksgiving dinner table? This swap is for tried and true family recipes that were handed down to you, or ones that you hope to hand down to future generations.

> To honor the individual whose recipes you are using please send your partners one usable kitchen item that represents the person and the recipe in some way. You could send a beautiful wooden spoon, a cool spatula, a lovely potholder, etc. Please include a note telling your partner about your inherited or found recipes and why you chose the item and how it relates to your recipes.

This swap is USA-only because it is in celebration of the US Thanksgiving holiday. It is open to &#8220;committed quality swappers only&#8221; with zero no sends. New users are not allowed. Each person has two partners to whom they send at least one recipe on a standard size recipe card and one quality usable new kitchen item. Signup closes October 20th.

The best thing about this fun recipe swap is that it is that the send date is early enough (November 1st) that you will get your new recipes in time to try them out on Thanksgiving! Yum!
