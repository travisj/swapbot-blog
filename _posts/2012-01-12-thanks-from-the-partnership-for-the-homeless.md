I&#8217;ve just learned that this year&#8217;s [Children&#8217;s Holiday Party](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/news/entry/childrens-holiday-party1/) put on by the Partnership for the Homeless was the biggest ever. The success of the event was in part thanks to the generosity of you, the Swap-bot community. Nearly 500 children attended the event at the Brooklyn Children&#8217;s museum and all received gifts &#8212; which included the gift cards and winter items that were donated by our site members as part of our [Winter Gift Donation Drive](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/12/05/holiday-donation-drive-update/).

**Thank you to all who participated in the donation drive!** Hopefully, we can do something similar next year&#8230;
