The [Swap-bot Member Appreciation Event](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/02/26/member-event-in-eugene-or-this-sunday/) yesterday in Eugene was a success! There were over 20 attendees. It was a lot of fun to meet Swap-bot users in person! We all spent most of the afternoon chatting and many of the attendees swapped ATCs. A big group from the Oregon Coast Art Traders groups from Florence came, and another big group from Grant&#8217;s Pass made the long drive to Eugene for the event. Thank you to everyone who came out!

A big &#8220;thank you&#8221; to users [muincat](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:muincat) and [coffeelatte](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:coffeelatte) for helping to organize and set up the event and to all of the generous individuals and businesses who donated [door prizes](http://blog.swap-bot.com/swap-bot-member-event-door-prizes/).

I didn&#8217;t take as many photos as I had hoped, but you can see a [few more on my flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/sets/72157614619525325/) and some on [coffeelatte&#8217;s flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/telltaleheart/). If anyone else has photos on the web of the event, please let me know!
