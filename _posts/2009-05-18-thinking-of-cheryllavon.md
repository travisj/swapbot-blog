[CherylLaVon](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CherylLaVon) , an active Swap-bot member, a lover of Dotee Dolls, and a good friend to many on Swap-bot, passed away yesterday after a long illness. Instead of a featured swap this week, I want to draw attention to some projects you can do in honor of Cheryl. 

If you would like to send a card to Cheryl&#8217;s family, user [Fairy20tails](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Fairy20tails) is collecting them to send as a group. Please read her [forum thread](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/35387) for more info. 

A swap, [In Honor of CherylLaVon](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/37378) , has been created by user [TheFallenAngel](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TheFallenAngel). For the swap users are asked to donate to [Cheryl&#8217;s American Cancer Society Memorial Fund](http://main.acsevents.org/site/TR/Events/MosaicofHope?pg=fund&fr_id=9910&pxfid=511453), add their memories of her to the memorial page, and send a card to her family via Fairy20Tails. Swap participants will not receive any items in the swap, but will be able to honor a friend and share their memories. 

User [pgk](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:PGK) has also created a graphic in memory of Cheryl that you can place on your profile page. You can find it on this [forum page](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/35409/3) . 

Cheryl will be greatly missed on Swap-bot, but it is wonderful to see so many of her friends honoring her life and memory. </u> </strong>
