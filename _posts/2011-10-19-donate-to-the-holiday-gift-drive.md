It is that time of year again: we are co-hosting another donation drive with [The Partnership for the Homeless](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5). You may remember that [last year](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/11/29/donation-drive-for-the-partnership-for-the-homeless/) we collected more than [325 hats, sets of gloves, and scarves for the winter gear drive](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/01/19/final-winter-donation-drive-update/)! Awesome! This year, we will be collecting gifts for NYC&#8217;s homeless children. 

**Did you know that nearly 15,000 children live in New York City shelters?** The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services and support for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate a donation of gift cards to be handed out to older children at their **Children&#8217;s Holiday Party on December 10th**.

**That is where the fantastic Swap-bot community comes in! Let’s put together a huge donation of gifts for The Partnership!!** 

We can accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $5 to $10 amounts to stores like AMC theaters, Barnes and Noble, H&M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Target. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC. Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless, but we can also accept toys and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations.

Send your donation to:

**Rachel Johnson
  
Swap-bot.com
  
285 5th Ave PMB 415
  
Brooklyn, NY 11215**

And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: **Each Swap-bot member who mails me a donation of one gift card or item will get one low (1 or 3) rating removed from their account!!** You must mail your donation to Swap-bot headquarters (address above) by **November 30th**. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will get a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only get one rating removed during this donation drive – although you are welcome to donate more than one item! (All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings &#8212; it is not a &#8220;free pass&#8221; for flaking.)

**International option:** If you are unable to purchase appropriate gift cards in your area, I am willing to accept cash donations via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com). I will then buy a gift card in your name to donate. Send Paypal donations to rachel -at- swap-bot.com and make sure to mark them as a &#8220;gift&#8221; instead of a payment. All Paypal donations of $5 or more will count toward a rating removal.
