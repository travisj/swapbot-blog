I am working on another HUGE blog post of all the images that have been coming in from the [100,000th swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/100000), but in the meantime, I have an announcement!

**Swap-bot is once again a [sponsor](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/sponsors.html) of the [Holiday Handmade Cavalcade](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/)!**

[<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/hhc2011.jpg" alt="" title="hhc2011" width="470" height="617" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8577" />](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/)

_Lovers of all things local and handmade are marking their calendars for Saturday December 3rd, when the local Etsy Team, [The {NewNew}](http://thenewnew.blogspot.com/), hosts its fourth annual [Holiday Handmade Cavalcade](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/) at the sprawling arts and music venue Public Assembly, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. From 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. shoppers can load up on clothing, jewelry, accessories, paper goods, bath and body treasures, toys, housewares and more, all handmade by some of the most creative local artisans and crafters in the NYC metropolitan area. </p> 

The first 200 shoppers to arrive will receive free goodie bags packed with a unique sampling of wares from the {NewNew}</i> [including Swap-bot goodies! yay!]_. Shoppers will also receive, with each purchase they make, a raffle ticket for a chance to win one of ten {NewNew} handmade prize packages._
