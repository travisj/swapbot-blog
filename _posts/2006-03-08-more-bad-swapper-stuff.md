I received some e-mail feedback from a swapper that said she wouldn&#8217;t want to know who she was receiving her stuff from. She said she wouldn&#8217;t have the guts to email her partner asking where the goods are. I completely agree. I know I wouldn&#8217;t email my bad swap partner either. And it makes it more fun to get a package in the mail completely unexpected.

So, that got me thinking. What does everyone think of a link that automatically emails your swap partner telling them you didn&#8217;t get your package? A downside that I can think of, is that if the swap has multiple partners, all the partners would get the email, even the ones that might have sent their items. I know I could look at who says they sent their items, but can we really trust that since it is just a link that someone clicks that says they sent their stuff?

I&#8217;ve talked with a few swappers and am going to implement some of the emails mentioned in a previous post. One week in advance everyone will get an email reminding them they are in the swap and if they can&#8217;t follow through with the commitment of the swap they need to drop out. Everyone will still get the current email the day after signup closes telling them to look at their swap partners. And as soon as the swap deadline sends, anyone that has not clicked the &#8220;I sent my items&#8221; link will get emails **everyday** reminding them to send out their stuff.
