They are so fun to work with and look great on dark paper&#8230; so, this week I am featuring the [Gel Pen ATC Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/125113) hosted by [PixelPixie](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:PixelPixie). 

ATC stands for Artist Trading Card. ATCs are 2.5&#8243; x 3.5&#8243; in size (the size of a usual playing card) and they are usually made of card stock. They can be hand drawn, decorated, and embellished in any way you like. 

For this **international** swap, you must use gel pens in your ATC in some way. You have just one partner to whom you send just one ATC. [Sign up before July 20th!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/125113)
