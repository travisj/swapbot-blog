Poor friday link love. It has been nearly three weeks since we&#8217;ve shared fun links, but we are back in action today! Enjoy.

  * The next holiday on my radar is Valentine&#8217;s Day. The photo above comes from [Sew4Home.com&#8217;s Valentine Patchwork Heart Sachet tutorial](http://sew4home.com/projects/fabric-art-a-accents/480-valentines-heart-sachets). It is easy to follow with great photography. (Speaking of Valentine&#8217;s Day, why not come join my [February Love Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/51544) &#8211; everyone is welcome!) 
  * If you are looking for other great craft tutorials, check out [The Long Thread&#8217;s Top 100 Tutorials of 2009](http://thelongthread.com/?p=5455). They should keep you busy for a while! 
  * I just discovered a great, new, crafty blog that you might want to check out: [Art vs. Craft](http://artvscraft.net/). It is published by a Canadian graphic designer and it has lots of crafty content and some free downloads. 
  * Speaking of blogs, I also just discovered [Funky Finds](http://www.funkyfinds.com/), a wild indie craft website. There is a [Funky Finds blog](http://funkyfinds.blogspot.com/) (which showcases independent artists, crafters, and designers), a <a href="http://funkyfinds.us/theshops/>Funky Finds marketplace</a> (where you can buy and sell unique creations), and a [Funky Town](http://funkyfinds.us/funkytown/) community. The whole site is really wacky in a totally fun way. 
  * I somehow missed the [amazing tutorial/article published on NotMartha.org last month about the adorable mini gingerbread houses she created to perch on the side of a mug of hot chocolate](http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2009/12/18/a-gingerbread-house-that-perches-on-the-rim-of-your-mug/). They are so very cute and a perfect winter treat!
  * Swap-bot user, [auntielolo](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:auntielolo), sent me this next link via Twitter: [Airmail-themed fashion](http://www.outsapop.com/2009/08/airmail-dressing.html). I love it! We could all start dressing just like Ernie the envie!

Happy 2010, swappers! Here&#8217;s to a new decade of swapping fun! xoxo, rachel
