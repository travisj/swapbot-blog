Do you love [Want Gf Back](http://solomontremblay.devhub.com/blog/1440430-boyfriend-wants-the-relationship-back/ "Want Gf Back") cats? Then, I&#8217;ve got a great featured swap for you this week: [Craft a Craft for your Cat](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/91720)!! The international swap is being hosted by [MrsRemingtion](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MrsRemington) and is open to all cat lovers (as long as you don&#8217;t have any 1 or 3 ratings).

From the swap description:

_&#8220;This swap is for crafters who are owned by cats and love it! Pretty simple instructions. Make a nice craft for your partner&#8217;s cat (or cats). If you don&#8217;t own a cat, you can still join and craft. How you ask? Well, the craft you receive from your partner could go to a friend&#8217;s cat or one of your area&#8217;s local cat shelters&#8230;. Put some love and attention in your cat craft, please. Make it a craft your cat would love to play with and wouldn&#8217;t mind sending it off to another cat. Also, please tell your partner something about your cat or cats in a little note.&#8221;_

You could make any sort of cat toy! Here are a few cat toy tutorials I quickly found online:

_p.s. the silly photo is of my family&#8217;s cat, Marvin, when he was a kitten about 17 years ago. He didn&#8217;t really like being dressed in doll clothes, but he was a good sport. He has since passed on, but I love looking at the old photos of him._
