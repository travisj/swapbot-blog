Did you know? **Over 25,000 children are sleeping in New York municipal shelters tonight.**

It is that time of year again when we can help brighten the holiday season for some of NYC&#8217;s homeless youth. Help us by donating to our **6th Annual Holiday Gift Donation Drive** to benefit [The Partnership for the Homeless](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org)!

The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services, support, and advocacy for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate our donation of new, unwrapped gifts and gift cards to be handed out to children at their **[Children&#8217;s Holiday Party](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/childrens-holiday-party) in Brooklyn on December 12th, 2015**.

**Message from The Partnership for the Homeless:** _</p> 

> Want to help make the holidays a little merrier for children and families who are homeless? Support our Annual Children&#8217;s Holiday Party!
> 
> Every December, The Partnership throws a gigantic celebration for over 400 children and families who are struggling with homelessness, providing holiday cheer through food, games, face painting, Santa, and of course — presents!
> 
> Every year we organize a festive holiday celebration for families who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness, providing a much-needed respite from the daily challenges of poverty in some of our city’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods.
> 
> Pulling off a party of this size is no small feat. It takes the hard work and dedication of many staff, sponsors, donors, and dozens of volunteers to make the magic happen.

**Let’s put together a huge donation of gifts for The Partnership!!** 

We can accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $10 or $20 amounts to stores like Target, Barnes and Noble, H&M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Best Buy. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC. **Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless** because they are versatile and good for older kids, but we can also accept new, unwrapped toys, books, and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations. [Read more info about what can be donated here.](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/sponsorship-opportunities/)

Send your donations by Friday, December 4th to:

**Rachel Johnson
  
Swap-bot.com
  
285 5th Ave PMB 415
  
Brooklyn, NY 11215**

And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: **Each Swap-bot member who sends in a donation of a gift card or item will earn the removal of one low (1 or 3) rating from their account!!** You must mail your donation to Swap-bot headquarters (address above) by **Friday, December 4th**. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will receive a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only earn one rating removal credit during this donation drive –- although you are welcome to donate more than one item! 

**The Fine Print:** _All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings &#8212; it is not a &#8220;free pass&#8221; for flaking. Everyone who donates will receive an email from me with the details of the rating removal credit. You can reply to that message any time to “cash in” your credit. I also make a permanent admin note (only visible to admin) on each donor’s account stating that they have a rating removal credit._

**International option:** If you are unable to purchase appropriate gift cards in your area or ship other gifts, I am willing to accept cash donations via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com). I will then buy a gift card in your name to donate OR donate the money directly to the Partnership for the Homeless, depending on their greater need. Use the button below to donate OR send Paypal donations to rachel -at- swap-bot.com. (Replace the -at- and spaces with @.) All Paypal donations of $10 or more will count toward a rating removal.

**Use this button to donate via Paypal:**
