I am sure that many of you are busy celebrating holidays this week with your families, so I have chosen a less intensive, quick, and easy swap to feature this week: [FIRSTS of the New Year Letter/Postcard swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/25658). The requirements of the swap, hosted by [iamjenii](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:iamjenii), are to send a letter or postcard to your partner describing your &#8220;firsts of the year.&#8221; From the swap description:

&#8220;In Japan, [the firsts of the new year are important](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_New_Year#Hatsum.C5.8Dde.2C_hatsuhinode.2C_the_.22firsts.22_of_the_year)! So let&#8217;s share with each other what the firsts of our new years are. Your first movie, outing, detail somethings (positive please!) of your new year to share! Please write your firsts in the form of a letter OR a postcard. Also, you can include ticket stubs. photos or whatever you want. This is a simple swap to share with each other some of each others&#8217; lives ðŸ˜€ I know, so cheezy.&#8221;

The swap is international and you must have over a 4.7 rating to join. Each participant only sends to one partner (which makes this swap super quick and easy). A great simple swap to tackle in the new year after all the holiday craziness is done! </div>
