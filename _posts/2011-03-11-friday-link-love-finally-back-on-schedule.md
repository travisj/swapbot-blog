March has flown by way too quickly for my liking, but I am finally starting to catch up! I&#8217;ve got a great list of links for you that I collected over the last few weeks&#8230; there is always something new to see on the internet! 

  * The colorful photo seen above is an image of the [house created by National Geographic that was inspired by the movie _Up_](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2011/03/up-inspired_flying_house.html). The small house was suspended from 300 balloons and flew for over an hour! It will be featured on a new National Geographic television series in the fall.
  * [Letters From Lauren](http://lettersfromlauren.com/) &#8211; Lauren is writing a letter a day in 2011. [She might even send one to you!](http://lettersfromlauren.com/send-me-a-letter/)
  * [Crochet your own Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle!](http://wolfdreamer-oth.blogspot.com/2011/03/tmnt-michaelangelo.html)
  * [BookCrossing.com](http://www.bookcrossing.com/) is kinda like Swap-bot, but it is all about sharing books. Some of the site&#8217;s members are organizing a convention in Washington DC on April 15-17th &#8211; [Learn more here!](http://www.bcindc.zoiks.org/)
  * I just discovered [Print-A-Craft.com](http://www.print-a-craft.com/). It is a site wear you can buy and sell craft patterns and tutorials.
  * Another new discovery: [YourATCStore.com](http://www.youratcstore.com/) &#8211; an online store dedicated to selling ATC supplies.
  * My love of S&#8217;mores strikes again: [tiny s&#8217;more bites recipe](http://www.fixmeasnack.com/2011/03/smore-bites-snack-recipe/) and [a fun &#8220;Scout&#8221; cookie idea from Cookie Crowd](http://ohjoy.blogs.com/my_weblog/2011/03/currently-snacking-on.html). 
      * Just for fun: [Check out SisterDiane&#8217;s review of _Kirby&#8217;s Epic Yarn_](http://www.craftypod.com/2011/03/07/a-video-game-made-from-craft-supplies-seriously/). It is a video game with graphics created completely with craft supplies! Very cute!</ul> 
    A few links for **St. Patrick&#8217;s Day**, which is coming up on March 17th:
    
      * Sheek Shindigs shows you how to set an adorable and inexpensive [St. Patrick&#8217;s Day party table](http://sheekshindigs.blogspot.com/2011/03/easy-inexpensive-diy-st-patricks-day.html). 
      * Craftzine.com shares a tutorial for making cheery [rainbow pudding cups](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2011/03/kids_kitchen_rainbow_pudding.html) that would actually be fun any time of year.
      * I love this super-simple, [pot of gold party favor idea from It Is What It Is](http://bethproudfoot.blogspot.com/2011/02/youre-my-pot-o-gold.html) that uses rainbow-colored licorice.
      * For the adventurous, a [Guinness Extra Stout chocolate pudding recipe on Sprinkle Bakes](http://www.sprinklebakes.com/2010/03/guinness-chocolate-pudding-or-chocolate.html).
      * Twig & Thistle has free, printable [St. Patrick&#8217;s Day coaters](http://www.twigandthistle.com/blog/2011/03/diy-st-patricks-day-coasters/) that would help make your day festive.
