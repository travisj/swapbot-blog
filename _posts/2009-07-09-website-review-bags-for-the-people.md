** We use recycled materials to utilize the wealth of existing materials, cutting back on use of new materials and natural resources. Plus we never know what kind of colors or patterns we will find. Using recycled materials ensures that each bag will be funky and unique!**Why Free?**Our bags are free so no one is excluded from actively participating in this simple lifestyle change. We want our bags to be a truly positive experience that will create dialogue and instill environmentally conscious thought while cutting back on plastic bag usage. Furthermore, for us, it is about our environment and making positive change, not making money.&#8221;</i>The group hosts bag making events around New York City for all ages, including school children and the elderly. They also give out their free bags at green markets around the city. Anyone can write to [Bags for the People](http://www.bagsforthepeople.org/getbags.htm) (and send a a self addressed and stamped envelope) and they will send you a free bag! Or, you can download their [free tutorial for making a bag out of an old t-shirt](http://www.bagsforthepeople.org/files/how_to.pdf). There is a lot more information about the organization on their [website](http://www.bagsforthepeople.org/), and I think you should check it out! If you get inspired by Bags for the People&#8217;s mission, you can also [donate](http://www.bagsforthepeople.org/donate.htm) fabric and/or equipment to the cause. What an easy way to make the world a little more green!
