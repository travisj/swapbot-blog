As if you didn&#8217;t already know, Christmas and New Years are approaching very quickly!! 

The [USPS](https://www.usps.com/holiday/) published their deadlines for mailing DOMESTIC items to arrive by Christmas Eve on December 24th: 

**December 15th (today!) &#8211; Standard Post速
  
December 20th &#8211; First-Class Mail速 & Priority Mail速
  
December 23rd &#8211; Priority Mail Express速**

Many of the deadlines for international Christmas mail have already passed. Although, you could still try their pricey Global Express Guaranteed service.

The postal services of most other countries offer similar deadlines, but check with your service&#8217;s website for their official dates. 

**Happy holiday mailing!**
