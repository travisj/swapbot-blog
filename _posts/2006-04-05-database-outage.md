We had a bit of a service outage tonight due, in part, to two main factors. First, the server went offline, leaving Swap-bot unreachable for about 30 minutes. Once the server was fixed, I discovered that the database was corrupted and needed to be repaired (don&#8217;t worry, no data was lost). This whole process took about 90 minutes to fix. Sorry for the outage.
