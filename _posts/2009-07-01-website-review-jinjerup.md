[Jinjerup](http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/) is the adorable online home for the designs, patterns, and illustraions of Chan Lynn, a professional designer. Lynn posts her new patterns nearly daily with short and cute explanations for how she came up with the ideas. 

This little snippet from the [Jinjerup about page](http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/search/label/about) will give you a feel for Lynn&#8217;s sweet personality:

_&#8220;I am constantly amazed by the small wonders of nature, science and the pleasure of the little things in life. They are unbelievably great sources of inspiration for anything. Seeing a well crafted typographic piece, acquiring a beautifully printed new publication are small yet just as meaningful notions which make my heart swell with design joy. What really takes the cake, is of course, coming up with designs to call your own.&#8221;_

The best part of Jinjerup is that Lynn gives away a new, [free download](http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/search/label/freebies) every week!! This week you can download adorable [Caterpillar Express labels](http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/2009/06/freebie-of-week-caterpillar-express.html).

You can also purchase items, like t-shirts and mugs, with Jinjerup designs from the [Jinjerup Store](http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/search/label/shop%20news). Lynn also has a personal blog, [Bric.A.Brac](http://brikbrac.blogspot.com/), and a [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/jinjerup). All of her posts are friendly and fun &#8211; a joy to read!
