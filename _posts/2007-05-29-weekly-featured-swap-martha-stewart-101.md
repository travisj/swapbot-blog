[<img class="alignright" src='http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/swap.jpg' alt='swap.jpg' />](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3984)In the past I was somewhat known for my slight obsession with Martha Stewart. I love her magazines the most (Weddings is just awesome!) and her new [craft line](http://www.marthastewartcrafts.com/index.php?v=msc_products&sort=-price&DCMP=KNC-G-MS_Crafts&pa=netramind&HBX_OU=50&HBX_PK=martha%20stewart%20craft) at Michaels is great. Because of my love for all things Martha, I couldn&#8217;t pass up the [Martha Stewart 101 swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3984) for this week&#8217;s featured swap. Here is the description from the swap page:

> This swap is for those that really enjoy Martha Stewarts creations from her t.v show, magazines and her online site. This swap requires you to send out a Martha Stewart inspired item, store bought or made or you can even send a kit with instructions to how to make something. Please send nice items out, nobody wants to get junk they will just end up trashing. You will have 1 partner and please try to make the swap $8-$10 before postage.

You must have a rating above 4.5 with a filled out profile in order to participate in this swap. I believe the swap is international, but you should check with the coordinator, [LadyYing](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=63), to make sure. Also, the swap closes for sign-up on June 1st, so act quickly if you would like to participate!
