**A handful of fun Friday links for my favorite blog readers ever:**

  * Someone, make me one of these [Salted Caramel Ice Cream Shots](http://sugarandcloth.com/2012/06/eats-salted-caramel-ice-cream-cake-shots/) stat!
  * Check out this fun [snail mail project pin board](http://pinterest.com/imamberlee/13-ounces-or-less-happy-mail/) on Pinterest.
  * This craft project seems ambitious, but very cool: [make a mini marquee sign with working lights!](http://ohhappyday.com/2012/11/mini-marquee-sign-with-lights/)
  * [A kind of silly, but magical DIY.](http://www.designsponge.com/2012/10/diy-project-tiny-doors.html)
  * [22 Of Your Childhood Style Icons, Revisited.](http://www.buzzfeed.com/summeranne/22-of-your-childhood-style-icons-revisited)
  * Two unique S&#8217;more variations for you this week: [Pumpkin S&#8217;more Cupcakes](http://www.howsweeteats.com/2012/11/pumpkin-smores-cupcakes/) and [Candy Cane S&#8217;mores](http://www.roxanashomebaking.com/candy-cane-smores-recipe/). 
  * Remember: you still have plenty of time to donate to the [**Swap-bot for Sandy Hurricane Relief Fund**](http://www.crowdrise.com/swapbot4sandy/) and earn a rating removal credit. As an alternative, The Partnership for the Homeless is collecting gift cards again for their children&#8217;s holiday party and would love our help.
