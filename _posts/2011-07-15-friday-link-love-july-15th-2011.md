  * The granny squares you see above are actually cookies!! Amazing, right? You can learn how to make them with the [Granny Square Cookie Tutorial](http://sugarandmeringue.squarespace.com/granny-square-cookies/) over on Sugar and Meringue.
  * [100 Fun Things to Do This Summer](http://www.honesttonod.com/honest-to-nod/2011/07/ambition.html)
  * [Eight fashion forward bracelet tutorials](http://whipup.net/2011/07/08/8-groovy-bracelets-to-make/) on Whip Up.
  * Just discovered this cute herb (yes, as in plants) website: [Poppy Swap](http://poppyswap.com/). It is an online marketplace where herbalists can sell and trade their handmade soaps, oils, balms, candles, and more.
  * Almost too cute: [a carnival-themed birthday dessert spread](http://blog.amyatlas.com/2011/07/carnival-guest-feature/).
  * I may have already share [Lovely Package](http://lovelypackage.com/) with you. It is a daily blog that showcases awesome examples of packaging design. Very inspiring ideas! Also, [Lovely Stationery](http://lovelystationery.com/).
  * If you love cooking and recipes, you might want to check out the brand new site, [Gojee](http://www.gojee.com/). I haven&#8217;t explored it much, but it has been described as StumbledUpon for recipes. You can search recipes by ingredient and keep your favorites bookmarked. Plus, the photos are stunning!
  * Speaking of recipes, my newest S&#8217;more find: [S&#8217;more Cupcakes](http://www.sophistimom.com/smores-cupcakes/) from Sophitimom. I would love that toasted marshmallow icing!! 
  * The Detroit Maker Faire is [looking for volunteers](http://www.detroitmakeithere.com/article/20110714/DM01/110719943) July 30-31. I went to the NY Maker Faire and it was a really awesome event. I recommend it!
