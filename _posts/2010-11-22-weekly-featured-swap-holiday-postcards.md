There are so many Christmas and holiday-themed postcard and greeting card swaps being hosted on Swap-bot right now that you are sure to find one that looks interesting. 

For this week&#8217;s featured swap, I chose two easy postcard swaps that are of a &#8220;holiday&#8221; theme, but that are open to all types of winter traditions. If you are interested in swapping postcards with people from all over the world and to learning about different holiday celebrations, join one or both of these swaps:

**[Holiday Traditions Postcard Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/77908)** &#8211; An international postcard swap hosted by [ladytiger7647](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ladytiger7647). Send one store-bought or handmade holiday or winter postcard that describes one of your holiday traditions to your one partner. Easy and fun! Sign up before November 30th. 

**[Winter Cheer Postcard Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/77327)** &#8211; An international swap hosted by [Goldfoxxe](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Goldfoxxe). Send one holiday or winter-themed postcard to each of your five partners. On each card, describe a winter holiday that you celebrate. Sign up before December 5th.

Both of these swaps are open to new users and also welcome participants of all faiths. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Festivus, Yule, New Years, or any other winter holiday, you can share your traditions and learn about others in these two postcard swaps. Happy holidays!
