_&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re all tired of reading about bad news on the newspapers &#8211; murders, violence, wars &#8211; so what about sending to your swap partner a journal full of GOOD and HAPPY news taken from your local/national newspapers? That&#8217;s what you have to do: you&#8217;ll collect as much newspapers&#8217; cuttings as you can and stick them into a journal/notebook, then send it to your swap partner. It&#8217;s quite cheap because you only have to buy a journal, but you can also make it on your own. If you read non-English newspapers, you can translate only the article&#8217;s title or the whole article if it&#8217;s short. The articles MUST talk about GOOD, HAPPY, NICE, or FUNNY things.&#8221;_ 

The swap sign up deadline for is October 25th, but the mail deadline is not until January 23rd. That gives you plenty of time to collect lots of feel-good news stories for your partner. What a great way to stay positive and focused on the good things that happen in the world everyday!
