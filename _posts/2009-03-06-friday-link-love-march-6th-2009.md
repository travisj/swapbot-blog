This week has blown by and the poor Swap-bot blog has not seen as much action as I would like. Let&#8217;s try to remedy that with an awesome collection of Friday links:

  * If you act fast, you could [win a copy of Craft:magazine&#8217;s most recent (and final) print issue](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2009/03/twitter_giveaway_follow_us_and.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954) . Simply [follow Craft:&#8217;s updates on Twitter](http://twitter.com/craft/) before Monday, March 9th. Three winners will be randomly chosen from their Twitter followers on Monday.
  * Cute knitting pattern for a [&#8220;Grumpasaurus&#8221;](http://kat-knits.blogspot.com/2009/03/free-pattern-grumpasaurus.html) from <a href=http://kat-knits.blogspot.com/">kat knits</a>.
  * A beautiful, fun [hand-carved stamp tutorial](http://blogdelanine.blogspot.com/search/label/handcarvedstampstutorial) on [Geninne&#8217;s Art Blog](http://blogdelanine.blogspot.com/). The blog features amazing illustrations and lovely photos. It is a new everyday read for me!
  * You probably have already heard about this, but if not, [Great Depression Cooking with Clara](http://www.greatdepressioncooking.com/Depression_Cooking/Welcome.html) is an amazing series of videos. &#8220;In each episode Clara prepares recipes that her mother made during the Great Depression. Clara shares her stories and wisdom from the Depression as she shows you how to make simple, inexpensive and delicious meals.&#8221;
  * An adorable [baby food jar pincushion tutorial](http://www.craftpudding.com/2009/03/tutorial-baby-food-jar-pincushion.html) is available on the cute blog, <a href=http://www.craftpudding.com/">CraftPudding</a>. 
  * I am going to promote my matchbox template PDF one more time because it is free and easy to use: [Download it here!](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/03/03/tuesday-tip-rachels-matchbox-template/)
Happy weekend, everyone! xoxo
