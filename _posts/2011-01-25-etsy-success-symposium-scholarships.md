Etsy.com is hosting a [Success Symposium](http://www.etsy.com/storque/seller-handbook/etsy-success-symposium-11615/) here in Brooklyn on Tuesday, February 8th. The event is a day-long conference at the Etsy headquarters for Etsy sellers that will help them take their small businesses to the next level. There will be workshops and talks led by industry experts, plus food, and a fun, in-person swap hosted by us, Swap-bot, at the end of the day! [Learn more about the speakers and details here.](http://www.etsy.com/storque/seller-handbook/etsy-success-symposium-11615/)

The sad news is that all of the tickets for the event are [sold out](http://www.etsy.com/listing/66145019/etsy-success-symposium-event). BUT WAIT! As one of the sponsors of the event, I have **three scholarships** available to give to three Swap-bot members who would like to attend the event. If you are in the New York CIty area (or will be on February 8th) and have an active Etsy store and Swap-bot account, you can apply to win one of the scholarships!

Apply today by sending me the information listed below to **rachel@swap-bot.com**:

Please only apply if you are seriously interested in attending the all-day symposium. All applications must be emailed to me by Thursday, January 27th, at 6 pm EST. I will contact the scholarship winners on Friday. (The Success Symposium scholarships only provide the conference ticket &#8212; not any travel expenses.)

If you won&#8217;t be in NY for the Symposium, don&#8217;t fret. The event will also be broadcasted live on the Etsy site!
