This week&#8217;s featured swap is the [Music to Craft to](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2175) swap coordinated by [Kimmie](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=5486). This swap is a great combination of crafting and music. Each swapper has three partners to whom they send original mix cds. This is a great way to show other swappers and crafters your personality and style! 

One note about cd swapping: We have had a swapper, or two, take advantage of cd swaps (in a way). A few people have been waiting to receive cds from their &#8220;sending&#8221; partners and then they copy those mixes and send the copies to their &#8220;receiving&#8221; partners. When swappers do this some members of the swap end up getting two of the same mix. That does not make them feel happy. Mix cds are a chance to show your creativity and personality. Have fun with it!
