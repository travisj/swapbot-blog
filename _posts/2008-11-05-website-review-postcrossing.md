[Postcrossing](http://www.postcrossing.com/) is a postal mail hobby website somewhat like Swap-bot. The tagline for the site is:

> “send a postcard and receive one back from a random person somewhere in the world!”

Once you create an account on Postcrossing you are assigned a random person from around the world to whom you send a postcard. Once you have sent, you are entered in the system to receive a postcard from a totally different random person from anywhere in the world. The system is highly organized and structured with each postcard receiving an identification number and being registered by its recipient. Postcrossing members have sent and registered over 1.5 million postcards! Amazing! There are people from [almost every country](http://www.postcrossing.com/explore/countries) using Postcrossing and the site is available in variety of different languages. The Postcrossing website is clear, simple, and easy to navigate with nice features, like a real-time postcard update feed on the main page. There is also a [blog](http://www.postcrossing.com/blog) and [forum](http://forum.postcrossing.com/). 

We definitely don&#8217;t want to lose any of our great Swap-bot postcard swappers to Postcrossing, but I don&#8217;t think it is possible to have too many fun options for receiving snail mail from around the world!
