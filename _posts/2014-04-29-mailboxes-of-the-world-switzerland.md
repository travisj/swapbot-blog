Another worldly mailbox for you, this time from Switzerland! I spotted this [Swiss La Poste](https://www.poste.ch/) box in Lausanne near the train station. Very clean! No graffiti for La Poste!!

Our stay in the country was very brief, so I only mailed a couple of postcards from Switzerland. I gotta send a bit of mail from every country I visit!!
