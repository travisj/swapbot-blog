By far the biggest problem we currently have with swap-bot is how to handle people that don&#8217;t send their swap items. This is something I don&#8217;t know the answer to.

There are a few ways we can go about identifying bad swappers and I will go over that shortly, but first we have to decide what we are going to actually do to bad swappers. If we ban them from all swaps for the rest of eternity, they will just sign up with a different email address and start swapping again. If we don&#8217;t do anything, they&#8217;ll keep getting swaps and not sending them. I&#8217;m open to suggestions here.

One solution to identify bad swappers would be to provide each person in the swap with a list of people that are sending swap items to them. They could then check off who they got something from and who they didn&#8217;t. This option potentially takes away some of the fun of a random swap. By seeing the list you then know who is sending you stuff. So maybe we hold off showing the list for 2 weeks or a month after the close of a swap. Again please leave suggestions.

The solution that I think I am going to attempt first is to send a few more reminder emails to all swappers and inundate the bad swappers with reminder/warning emails. I plan on sending the following emails:

  * One week prior to close &#8211; A reminder that you are in the swap and you can still drop it if you aren&#8217;t going to send your items
  * The day after signup for the swap closes &#8211; An email letting swappers know they can now view the people they send their swap items to
  * Daily (every other day, weekly, I don&#8217;t know yet) emails to people that have not clicked the &#8220;I sent my items&#8221; link for the swap.

The last email will hopefully will make bad senders follow through with their commitment to the swap. Since they will only be able to make the emails stop sending by clicking the link on the swap page, hopefully they will send their items. I am tossing around the idea of having a second way to stop the &#8220;late&#8221; reminder emails. I am thinking of putting a second link in the email that says something like, &#8220;I do not plan on sending my swap items. Please make these emails stop.&#8221; If the swapper clicks this link, an email will get sent to everyone in the swap letting everyone know that this swapper let the entire swap down. The email would say who didn&#8217;t get their items as a result of this person choosing to not send their items. How&#8217;s that for a little public humiliation. 

Please share any other ideas on the this subject or any others related to swap-bot.

For starters, a suggestion I received via email this weekend:

> The only suggestion I have is that you institute some way of recognizing partners that don&#8217;t keep up their end of the bargain. I clicked the &#8220;Sent&#8221; button, perhaps you could add a &#8220;Received&#8221; button as well, which would then track against those who reported sending their swap. And, if a person slips up, you would prohibit them from signing up for any other swap until they met their first commitment. Just a thought.
