Thanks to [travisj](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj), our trusty Swap-bot technology wizard, for his help finding many of these links this week&#8230;

  * We know about magic yarn balls here on Swap-bot (you know, the balls of yarn filled with little surprise treasures), but leave it to Martha&#8217;s craft department to come up with [magic crepe paper carrots](http://thecraftsdept.marthastewart.com/2011/04/crepe-paper-carrots.html)! Just in time for Easter! (seen above) 
  * [How to make t-shirt yarn.](http://www.craftpassion.com/2009/05/recycle-tutorial-making-of-t-shirt-yarn.html)
  * This [&#8220;Celebrate Me&#8221; spring party](http://www.hostessblog.com/2011/03/celebrate-me-fresh-modern-spring-party/) is probably a little over-board in the style department considering that the attendees look to be about four years old, but it is definitely cute! I like the marshmallow pops.
  * For a more masculine kid&#8217;s birthday party, check out this [DIY Lego Party from Craftzine.com&#8217;s Feast & Frolic section](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2011/03/diy_lego_birthday_party.html). 
  * [Baker&#8217;s Royale](http://www.bakersroyale.com/) &#8211; my new favorite food blog! Such great party recipes, like these [S&#8217;mores Pops](http://www.bakersroyale.com/fast-and-easy/smores-pop/) and these mini [Strawberry Margarita Jello Shooters](http://www.bakersroyale.com/fruit/strawberry-margarita-jell-o-shooters/)!
  * I love these little [ceramic tags](http://www.paperboatpress.bigcartel.com/product/5-pack-little-ornaments) from Paper Boat Press that you can use to decorate baked goods that you give to family and friends.
  * Free, printable, map-themed [love notes](http://www.kindovermatter.com/2009/11/freebie-printable-mini-map-love-note.html) on Kind Over Matter.
  * Yay! [I got to attend another Martha Stewart Show taping on Tuesday.](http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=3904) It was another great time!
  * Just for fun: This kind of grosses me out and is also kind of awesome &#8212; [Ham Solo](http://geeks.thedailywh.at/2011/04/07/geek-news-fun-with-ham-of-the-day/).
