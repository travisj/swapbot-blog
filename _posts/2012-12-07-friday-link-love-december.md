Wonderful greeting cards from the [Holiday/Christmas Card Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/129286) keep arriving in the Swap-bot mail box from all over the world! (The cute stamp above was on a card from the UK.) What a wonderful holiday gift! **Thank you all so much.** Sometimes it is easy to get caught up in the more difficult aspects of maintaining Swap-bot, but spreading friendship and cheer through the mail is really what it is all about. Thanks for sending some big time cheer our way!
