Hurricane Sandy hit our community, New York City, and all of the the East Coast region very hard. People are hurting. Homes and businesses and lives have been lost. We want to help those in need. Want to join us?

For this year's Swap-bot holiday charity drive, let's donate to Hurricane Sandy Recovery efforts via the Red Cross. I've set up a [**Swap-bot 4 Sandy Crowdrise campaign**](http://www.crowdrise.com/swapbot4sandy). Financial donations can be made by major credit card and help the Red Cross provide shelter, food, emotional support and other assistance to those affected by disasters like Hurricane Sandy.

Like in our past holiday donation drives, there is an extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: **Each Swap-bot member who donates to our [Crowdrise campaign](http://www.crowdrise.com/swapbot4sandy/)</a> (or by one of the alternative donation options below) will get one low (1 or 3) rating removed from their account!!**

**Alternate donation options:**

If you would prefer to donate a gift or winter gear to [The Partnership for the Homeless](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/) Children's Holiday Party, I am accepting those donations, too. We can accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $10 amounts to stores like AMC theaters, Barnes and Noble, H&M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Target. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC. Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless, but we can also accept new toys and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations.

**Paypal option:** If you are unable to use a major credit card on Crowdrise and/or cannot purchase appropriate gift donations in your area, I am willing to accept cash donations via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com). Send Paypal donations to rachel -at- swap-bot.com. All Paypal donations will go toward [Swap-bot's Crowdrise campaign for the Red Cross](http://www.crowdrise.com/swapbot4sandy/fundraiser/rachelj) and all Paypal donations of $10 or more will count toward a rating removal.

**Details:** _You must donate by **November 30th**. However you chose to donate, you **must include your Swap-bot username with your donation**. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will get a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only get one rating removed during this donation drive â€“ although you are welcome to donate more than one item! (All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings &#8212; it is not a &#8220;free pass&#8221; for flaking.)_
