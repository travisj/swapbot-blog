Swap-botters who donate receive a rating removal credit as a small reward. [Learn more in this blog post.](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2012/11/02/swap-bot-hurricane-relief-donation-drive/) 

If you&#8217;d like to help out those in need after the storm in a more tangible and crafty way, iSewAcademy is hosting [25th Dresses, a handmade children&#8217;s clothing donation drive](http://isewacademy.com/25th-dresses/). All of the details on how to donate are listed on the [iSewAcademy blog](http://isewacademy.com/25th-dresses/). 

During the holiday season there are so many opportunities to help those in need. In addition to our efforts to help those affected by Hurricane Sandy, we are also working with [**The Partnership for the Homeless**](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/) once again this year. They host a children&#8217;s holiday party every year and would love to receive gift items for the kids. 

Donations to the Partnership will also earn a rating removal credit and we can accept the following items: Gift cards in $10 amounts to stores like AMC theaters, Barnes and Noble, H&M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Target. Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless, but we can also accept new toys and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations. You can mail your donations to me: **Rachel Johnson, 285 5th Ave PMB 415, Brooklyn NY 11215.**

Thank you all so much for your support of these important causes and organizations. **The Swap-bot community blows me away every year with their generosity!**
