This week we are featuring a swap which could lead to a life-long friendship: the [&#8220;In Pursuit of the Perfect Pen Pal&#8221; swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/23699) hosted by [quietlyquirky](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:quietlyquirky) . If you are a lover of letters, or an avid writer who is looking for a penpal, this swap is for you! For the swap you will have five partners, to whom you will send each a letter describing what you are looking for in a penpal. The high number of partners provides a better chance of finding a great penpal match. 

From the swap description:

> Do you love having pen pals, but have been frustrated with the frequency or quality of the letters you&#8217;ve received in the past? Or perhaps you really would like to establish a true postal friendship with someone you jive with, but you haven&#8217;t quite been able to find that special person yet. Or maybe you&#8217;d just like to have a loyal swap partner who shares your love of a certain craft. Well, here&#8217;s where I hope this swap will assist you in finding the &#8220;perfect&#8221; pen pal!
> 
> Send each of your partners a letter; it can be typed or handwritten, whichever you prefer and use most often. Introduce yourself thoroughly, and then write about what you are looking for in a pen pal. The key here is to be clear and descriptive&#8230; For example: If you don&#8217;t want to be pen pals with someone who only writes once every 6 months, say that. If you&#8217;re looking for someone who loves to read and discuss books, say that.
> 
> Some ideas of things to include in your letter:
> 
> frequency &#8211; will you write once a week, once a month, etc.
> 
> style &#8211; do you prefer handwritten letters, typed, or both
> 
> swap &#8211; would you rather just exchange letters, or would you like to do an occasional swap
> 
> beliefs &#8211; if you&#8217;d like to share beliefs/politics/etc. with your pal, or if those do not matter to you in a friend
> 
> age &#8211; if you&#8217;d rather write to someone close to your own age, say so, or state an age range
> 
> lifestyle &#8211; moms looking for other moms, dog lovers looking for other dog lovers, health nuts looking for other health nuts, etc.
> 
> hobbies/crafts &#8211; if you&#8217;d like to have a pal who shares your love of a specific hobby or craft
> 
> rather-nots &#8211; whatever you&#8217;d &#8220;rather not&#8221; have <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The swap is open to USA residents with a 4.5 rating, or higher. New users with a full profile are allowed. The swap is only open for sign up through October 31st, so act quickly if you would like to join. Your letters must be sent by November 21st, 2008. Make sure to read the full swap description before signing up. Happy swapping!

_\*\\*\* We plan to feature a new, unique, public swap each week here on the Swap-bot blog. If you would like to have your swap featured, or have a suggestion for a weekly featured swap, please let me know at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. The swaps must have some sort of creative aspect (not just purchasing items), they must be public, and the coordinator must be in good standing on Swap-bot. The more unique and creative, the better! \*\**_
