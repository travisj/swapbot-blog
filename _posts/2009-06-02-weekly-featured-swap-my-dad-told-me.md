In honor of the upcoming Father&#8217;s Day holiday, this week&#8217;s featured swap is the [&#8220;My Dad Told Me&#8221; postcard swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/36133) hosted by [chrissy32](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:chrissy32) . The swap is a fun and simple way to honor your dad by sharing a few of the things he taught you. From the swap description:

_For many, much of who we are is shaped by the things our parents told us when we were children. This is about Dear Old Dad. My dad told me to be kind if I wanted to keep friends or a husband, to apologize when I was wrong, to hold the paintbrush like a man!, to&#8230;but wait for the postcard! Let&#8217;s share the important things our fathers told us that have in some way shaped our lives, in honor of Father&#8217;s Day on June 21. In this swap you will have three partners. Send 1 postcard to each. Postcards can be any image that in some way relates to fatherhood or the home or childhood._

You must sign up for the swap before June 8th, and send before the 18th. Father&#8217;s Day is on June 21st.
