For example, I spend a lot of time on my [personal blog](http://www.rljart.com/blog/). I take lots of photos for it and spend time writing about things that are important to me. It is like my scrapbook and I love to share it with others, which is why I joined this week&#8217;s featured swap: [I Love Your Blog!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/73668) 

This international email swap is hosted by [Jex](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:jex), and all users with a 4.85 rating, or higher, are welcome to join. Everyone will be assigned seven partners, and here are the swap instructions:

  1. Send your partners the link to your blog.
  2. Then, go to your partners&#8217; blogs and grab a button or graphic. You have to link to them in your own blog, so your followers and readers will know your partners later.
  3. Write a blog entry talking about this swap, and write what you like the most of your partners&#8217; blogs. 

Sign up for the I Love Your Blog swap by October 15th and discover some awesome new blogs! (Like [Jex&#8217;s blog](http://jexyland.blogspot.com/), for example!)
