This week&#8217;s featured swap is an annual independent swap that is being hosted on Swap-bot for the first time. Previously, the [freshly{blended}](http://freshlyblended.blogspot.com/) and [cake & pie](http://cakeandpie.typepad.com/) [Holiday Ornament Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/24124) (now in its third year) has had hundreds of participants. This year they have made it a public swap on Swap-bot, so any Swap-bot members can participate. The swap is international and each participant will send handmade holiday ornaments to ten partners. Here are some of the directions from the swap&#8217;s description: 

  * Design a handmade ornament that you can create multiples of and make your ornaments.
  * Package your ornaments well&#8230;especially if you create anything fragile.
  * Send one of your ornaments to each person on the list of 8-10 other swap participants in your group by December 10th.
  * Sit back, relax and wait as you receive 8-10 fabulous handcrafted ornaments in the mail!

This swap is a great way to meet lots of new Swap-bot members, as many of the participants already signed up are new to the site. Established Swap-bot members would be a great addition to the group to help show how our site works. Make sure to read the [entire swap description before signing up](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/24124). Have fun & happy swapping!
