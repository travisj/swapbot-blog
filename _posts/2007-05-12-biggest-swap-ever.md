The [Ratings Booster swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3277) hosted by [Kimmie](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=5486) currently has 277 participants! That is the largest swap we have seen on Swap-bot, so far. (Kimmie also has 58 hearts, which I am not sure, but may be the highest number of hearts received by one participant.) Will <a href="[Ratings Booster](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3277) reach **300** participants by the sign up deadline on May 15th?! Go check it out and see if you want to sign up for this landmark swap.
