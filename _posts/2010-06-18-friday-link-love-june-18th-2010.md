Father&#8217;s Day is on Sunday (in the US) and there is still time to make a cool DIY gift!

  * Fold these cute on Paper Crave (seen in the photo above).
  * I love this superhero-themed (with free printables) from Jordan Ferney (of Oh Happy Day!) on Alphamom.
  * There are more over on MarthaStewart.com.
  * And just for laughs, does your dad need some ?
