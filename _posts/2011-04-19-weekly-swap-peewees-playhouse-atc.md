Oh, how I used to love [Pee Wee&#8217;s Playhouse](http://www.peewee.com/) when I was a kid! It was such a weird, fun, wacky show. I wanted to live in the Playhouse for real. (Remember the [theme song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKcYGOIJhqo)? That is Cindi Lauper singing!) My mom had taped the [Christmas Special](http://www.amazon.com/Pee-Wees-Playhouse-Christmas-Special/dp/B0002IQASG) &#8211; using our VCR, of course &#8211; and we would watch it every year! 

So, I couldn&#8217;t resist featuring the [Pee Wee&#8217;s Playhouse ATC Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/89334?new=1) this week! The international swap is hosted by [missmuffcake](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:missmuffcake) and it is open for sign up through April 29th. 

For the swap, you create one ATC for your one partner that features one character or element from Pee Wee&#8217;s Playhouse. It could feature Pee Wee, Miss Yvonne, Mailman Mike, Cowboy Curtis, Jambi the Genie, Pterri, Conky, Chairry, or any of the other crazy characters! (One of my favorites was Chicky Baby, back-up singer for the Cool Cat, all-puppet, bebop band.)

All users with a 4.8 rating, or higher are welcome in the swap. [Sign up now!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/89334?new=1)

Just for fun: [Pee Wee gets an iPad on Funny Or Die](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiDHUNiurqY&feature=related).
