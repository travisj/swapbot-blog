March is National Craft Month! What a terrific reason to celebrate! For those of us who love to craft, vow to try a new crafting technique during National Craft Month; or perhaps you can teach someone how to do your favorite craft. National Craft Month can also be the perfect excuse to pull all those half-finished projects out of their hiding places and get them done. For those who don&#8217;t make crafts, what better reason to start crafting? Crafting has many benefits; it can help reduce stress, bring families closer together, and you can learn new skills also!
