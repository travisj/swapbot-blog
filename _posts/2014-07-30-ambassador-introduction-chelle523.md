They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**Say hello to our next Ambassador, [chelle523](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:chelle523)!** Chelle523 is an **Original Member**, which means she has been on Swap-bot since before June, 2007. She has completed more than 360 swaps and received more than 650 &#8220;5&#8221; ratings! Amazing!

**Ambassador Region:** USA &#8211; Midwest Region

At the time I was on a Yahoo swapping group that traded ATCs, and had gotten discouraged at the lack of diversity in swaps and wanted to expand. A friend told me about Swap-bot and I&#8217;ve been hooked ever since!&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I love Swap-bot &#8211; it combines the best in artistic and creative expression, friendship and generosity, fun and it allows me to &#8220;meet&#8221; people from all corners of the globe! I love meeting people that share my interests and talents and I love meeting people whose lives and skills are completely different than my own! That little burst of excitement I get when I see an envelope or package in the mailbox is enough to make me a Swap-botter for life! I mean, when 90% of what we get in the mail is bills or junk, how can getting a beautiful envelope from across the world not put a smile on your face!?!&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;My favorite types of swaps are journals, pen pal swaps and whimsy jars, but honestly, I like just about every kind of swap we have.&#8221; _Obviously, chelle523 is also interested in ATCs. Check out three of her wonderful ATC creations below&#8230;_
