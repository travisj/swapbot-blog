I have been somewhat obsessed with garland decorations lately. There are so many inspiring ideas on the internet! For example, the pretty tassel garland above is from [Confetti System](http://www.confettisystem.com/) &#8211; an extremely cool artist duo that creates amazing installations. If you&#8217;d like to try your hand at making your own handmade garland, join the [Banners, Pennants, and Garlands Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/78946) hosted by [saellys](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:saellys). 

From the swap description:

_Garlands are beautiful all year&#8211;especially if they&#8217;re handmade! In this swap, you will send one yard (36&#8243;) of handmade garland, pennants, or banners to one partner. These can be paper, fabric, beads, or any other hangable ephemera on sturdy string, ribbon, wire, or anything else that can support the weight. This is sender&#8217;s choice. Get creative! And make sure you leave space at either end to tie to a nail or support, or add metal rings or washers to act as grommets._

The swap is international and accepts experienced swappers with a 4.75 rating, or higher. [Sign up before Friday!!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/78946)
