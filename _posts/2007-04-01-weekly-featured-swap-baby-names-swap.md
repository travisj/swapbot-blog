[<img class="alignleft" src='http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/swap.jpg' alt='swap.jpg' />](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2845)This week I couldn&#8217;t pass up the [Baby Names Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2845) for our featured swap. I do not have kids, and I not planning on having any for a while, but I love thinking about baby names! 

The Baby Names swap is coordinated by [Jellybaby](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=6934) and it is an international swap. Each participant has four partners to whom they send their list of top ten girl names and top ten boy names. A quick and easy swap, but make sure you read all of the [instructions](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2845) before signing up. This swap would be great for expecting parents who haven&#8217;t picked out a name, yet!
