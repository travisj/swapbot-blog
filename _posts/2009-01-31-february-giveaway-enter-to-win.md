Doodlebug is one of my favorite scrapbooking brands. Their stuff is always exceptionally cute! The kit includes one True Love Sugar Coated Cardstock Sticker Sheet, one Loopy Love accent satin ribbon, one package of Ladybug colored jewels, one package of Cupcake colored brads, one 12” x 12” sheet of Valentine Argyle accent paper, one 12” x 12” sheet of Heart Strings accent paper, one 12” x 12” sheet of Ladybug Picnic accent paper, one 12” x 12” sheet of Very Cherry accent paper, and six 12” x 12” sheets of assorted cardstock.

To enter the drawing for this giveaway simply comment on this blog post with your answer to the following question:

**What is your favorite handmade valentine memory, given or received? </em> </em>** 

Each person can only enter this giveaway once. You must have a Swap-bot account in good standing (not suspended) with a valid mailing address to enter. You must include your Swap-bot username somewhere in your comment. You must comment on or before Friday, February 20th, to be entered in the drawing. The winner will be randomly drawn on Saturday, February 21st. Obviously, this lovey-dovey kit won&#8217;t arrive to the winner in time to make Valentine&#8217;s, but it would work great for scrapbooking the holiday or making love notes. If you have trouble commenting on the blog, you can send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. Good luck! </strong> </strong>
