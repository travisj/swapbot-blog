One of my favorite things about Swap-bot is that it has inspired me to try out new crafts (did anyone say matchboxes?), so this week I chose to feature a swap that is based on that exact premise: the [Mini DIY Craft Kits Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3508) hosted by [Origami Grace](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=5085). Each participant only has one partner in this swap, to whom they will send a craft kit of their own creation. From the swap description: 

> You will assemble (or buy) a small kit that will provide all materials and instructions needed for your partner to make one or two complete items: for example &#8211; two ATCs, two handmade notecards, one mini scrapbook or sticky pad book, one crocheted bookworm or hairband, one mini cross-stitch kit or other embroidery, one pair of beaded earrings, one pendant, one jeweled pin or broach, one bracelet, one mini picture frame, one refrigerator magnet, one altered altoid tin, one matchbox shrine, etc. Omit glue, scissors, tape &#8211; I&#8217;m gonna assume we all have that.

Please also note that this is a US only swap and it has a high rating requirement (4.7). The signup deadline is May 15th. If you like the idea of this swap, there is also the [Craft Kit Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3519) and the [ATC DIY Kits Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3622). Check them out!

For inspiration I found a few links to DIY kits you can purchase on the internet. (I believe that for the swaps you are technically supposed to create the kits yourself, but I thought we could get ideas from some of the cool craft kits out there.) Below you will see the [La Petite Embroidery Kit](http://www.sublimestitching.com/lapetite.html) from Sublime Stitching and the [Candy Shop Magnolia Paper Flower Kit](http://www.paper-source.com/cgi-bin/paper/4071291601.html?cm_id=2950.070) from Paper Source. I also love this [Cup O&#8217; Joe Pincushion Kit](http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=5902145)
