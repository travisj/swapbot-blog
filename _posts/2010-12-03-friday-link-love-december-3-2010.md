Hello, swap friends! I feel like I haven&#8217;t done a really good link love post in a few weeks&#8230; but that all changes now! I have a collection of quality links for you to explore&#8230; lots of holiday items because it is that time of year! 

  * Two simple and sweet holiday tutorials on Creature Comforts: [SCANDINAVIAN INSPIRED STAR GARLAND](http://www.creaturecomfortsblog.com/home/2010/11/30/diy-scandinavian-inspired-star-garland.html) (seen above) & [5 MINUTE TINSEL GARLAND WREATH](http://www.creaturecomfortsblog.com/home/2010/11/16/diy-5-minute-tinsel-garland-wreath.html).
  * Lots of us are attending cookie exchanges this time of year. If you need some recipe ideas, check out [Better Homes & Gardens&#8217; Cookie Exchange Favorites](http://www.bhg.com/holidays/christmas/cookies/favorite-christmas-cookies/) and [Martha Stewart&#8217;s Cookie Swap Ideas & Recipes](http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/cookie-swap).
  * Better Homes and Gardens also has a great [group of felt ornament tutorials](http://www.bhg.com/holidays/?sssdmh=dm17.484218&day=69&esrc=nw100d1_11_69&email=2935584459).
  * And speaking of felt ornaments, these [mini matryoshka doll ornaments on Sew to Speak](http://sewtospeak.blogspot.com/2010/11/aprils-mini-matryoshkas.html) are adorable!
  * If you are getting started on your holiday gifts already, you may be interested in this [lovely, free, downloadable wrapping paper](http://www.lovemae.com.au/collection_freepaper.htm) from [Mae](http://www.lovemae.com.au/index.htm) (an Australian decal/design company).
  * Adorable Jenny B. Harris has a free sewing pattern for a [Swedish Dala Horse Stocking](http://allsorts.typepad.com/allsorts/2010/12/freebie-pattern-swedish-dala-horse-stocking.html) on her blog today.
  * If you celebrate the countdown to Christmas, you may like this [homemade advent calendar idea on Between the Lines](http://pm-betweenthelines.blogspot.com/2010/12/advent-calendar-oh-yes.html). Also, [Whip Up has a great round-up of over a dozen DIY advent calendars](http://whipup.net/2010/12/03/homemade-advent-calendar-roundup/).
  * [Posty Pals](http://postypals.blogspot.com/) &#8211; a blog all about fabric postcards.
  * Amazing [&#8220;Secrets of the Self-employed&#8221;](http://www.kerismith.com/blog/secrets-shared/) by illustrator Keri Smith. She has some great advice for anyone who aspires to be an artist, or simply a creative individual. My favorite tip: &#8220;Donâ€™t worry about whether or not you are good (good is subjective and most people are not great judges of their own work), just keep making work.&#8221;
  * If you are in New York this weekend, come check out the [Holiday Handmade Cavalcade](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/) in Nolita. It is a craft show organized by [The NewNew Etsy Street Team](http://thenewnew.blogspot.com/) and Swap-bot is a sponsor. The first 200 visitors get a swag bag!

Anything awesome that I neglected to include on this list?
