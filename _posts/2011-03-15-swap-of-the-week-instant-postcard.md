I love this swap idea!! I just joined the [Instant Postcard Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/84903) hosted by [OverMoon](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:OverMoon). Instant postcards are a new concept for me, but basically they are Polaroids (or other instant film photographs) sent &#8220;naked&#8221; (without an envelope) as a postcard. You put the stamp directly on the photo and write your recipient&#8217;s address on the white potion of the photo. (The address info has been removed from the two instant postcards seen above.) Very cool! If you own an instant camera (and film), sign up for [Instant Postcard Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/84903) by March 21st. Then, simply take your photo and send it to your one international partner by March 25th.
