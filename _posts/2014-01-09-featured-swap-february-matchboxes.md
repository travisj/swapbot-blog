You already know I am a crazy lady when it comes to Valentine&#8217;s Day! I just can&#8217;t help it. I love all things pink & red & glittery & lovey dovey. I know not everyone feels the same way &#8230;which is why this week&#8217;s featured swap encompasses a bit more than just the holiday of love.

Even if you aren&#8217;t a huge Valentine fan, come join my [**February Love Matchbox Swap**](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/166461)!! Your matchbox does not necessarily have to be Valentine&#8217;s Day related. It can be of any February theme, like winter, President&#8217;s Day, MLK Jr Day, my birthday!! haha! The swap is totally sender&#8217;s choice, so you can get started on your February crafting now. (You can download a free, printable matchbox template [HERE](http://blog.swap-bot.com/rachels-matchbox-template/).)

This is the sixth edition of this **international** paper crafting swap and I hope we can get a huge group of participants. For the swap, you simply decorate and fill **one** matchbox for **one** partner and get it in the mail by February 7th. New members and experienced members with a 4.9 rating, or higher, are welcome to join. But I will be weeding out anyone questionable. [Sign up by January 27th!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/166461)
