The last two weeks have been a very tough time for Swap-bot as we moved the offices across the country. We had very limited access to the internet while we were traveling and getting settled, which prevented me from doing anything beyond very basic admin duties. Obviously, that was not the original plan, but we did our best with what we had&#8230; and now Travis, Crusher, and I are settled in New York City and I am back in action on Swap-bot! Woot! I hope to announce the winners of the most recent Swap-bot swag giveaway later today, so stay tuned. I am also working my way through back-logged email and I thank you for your patience with my response time. My goal is to get totally caught up and become a highly efficient Admin machine by the end of the week! xoxo, Rachel
