Finding extra cash for crafting and swapping is getting more and more difficult. Well, Heather Mann (of Croq Zine fame) has come to our rescue! She created [Dollar Store Crafts](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/) last September to bring together simple, fun, inexpensive craft ideas and tutorials. All of the crafts use materials purchased at dollar stores, at dollar sections in stores, or at discount stores for $1 or less. The projects featured on the site range from [silly](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2009/01/toy-animal-rug/) and [wacky](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2009/01/make-a-dress-out-of-bath-poufs/) to high-concept projects that are inspired by [high-end designers like Prada](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2009/01/make-prada-earrings/). New project ideas and tutorials are posted to [Dollar Store Crafts](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/) each day, and they are curated from across the internet and from the site&#8217;s readers. All of the craft projects are intended to cost ten dollars or much less, but they do assume that you have some supplies on hand, like scissors and glue. 

If you are ready for recession-proof crafting help, [Dollar Store Crafts](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/) is the place to go. You will be amazed with the kinds of things you can make with just a few dollars!
