For the swap, you make one 3 to 6-inch tall Dotee Doll in a 1980s theme for your one partner. The swap description describes the theme best:

_Do you LOVE the 80&#8217;s as much as I do?? I&#8217;m an 80&#8217;s chick, so what I would love love LOVE is an 80&#8217;s themed Dotee! You can make your dotee in any 80&#8217;s style. Think Madonna, The Cure, Punky Brewster, Michael Jackson, punk rock, headbands, leg warmers, mixed matched socks, neon clothes, jelly bracelets, crimped hair, etc. Come on all you hardcore 80&#8217;s girls, let&#8217;s make this swap &#8220;like, totally tubular&#8221;!!!_

Sounds like a lot of fun! To join the swap you must have over a 4.9 rating and have completed at least five swaps. [Sign up before Monday, November 15th!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/77062)
