I love the theme of the international [Handmade Holiday Tolerance Card Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/106591) hosted by [Amigirl](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Amigirl). It is a handmade greeting card swap that allows you to express your winter holiday wishes, no matter what you celebrate this time of year. 

From the swap description:

_You will have 5 partners. You will send each of them one winter holiday card that you will make by hand.. Store-bought cards are not allowed, although of course you will likely be using store-bought elements. You can use any paper or fabric crafting techniques to make the cards. The cards should be pretty and something you&#8217;d want to display in your home. </p> 

**ANY holiday celebrated this time of year is acceptable as your theme! You may do Christmas, New Year, Chanukah, Kwanzaa, Festivus, or whatever you celebrate at this time.** You may certainly use your own spiritual or religious themes in the cards. Everyone is to exercise their tolerance here in what they receive and enjoy the well wishes no matter what religion they come from. Let&#8217;s all enjoy the variety of the spirituality that Swap-bot has. You are not to make any remark here about what type of holiday card you will accept, nor are any of you to rate down if you get a card that isn&#8217;t in line with your religious view. Tolerance is our watchword!</i>

What a great swap! Diversity makes swapping more interesting and more fun! 

(And in the same general theme, check out my [Holiday Fun Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/106322). You can create a matchbox in any winter or holiday theme you choose! The photo above is from a previous year&#8217;s swap.)
