It is Day 2 of the [Alt Summit](http://www.altitudesummit.com/), a design and blogging conference in Salt Lake City. It is a somewhat overwhelming experience, but I&#8217;m having fun, meeting new people, and learning a lot about online business. 

There are so many cool blogs and websites out there! Here are a just few that I have discovered (or rediscovered) so far at Alt:

**Very Awesome Blogs:**

  * [Mighty Girl](http://mightygirl.com/) &#8211; the original.
  * [Making it lovely](http://makingitlovely.com/) &#8211; one of my all-time faves!

  * [Oh Happy Day!](http://ohhappyday.com/) &#8211; party planning projects.

Too much to share! Conferences always cause information overload&#8230; but it is good to discover new things. (If you are curious about the Alt Summit conference, I also posted a [quick update over on Ace](http://www.acedepartment.com/blog/2012/01/20/alt-summit-update/).)
