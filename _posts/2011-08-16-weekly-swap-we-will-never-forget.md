I was going to college in Iowa on September 11th, 2001, but like all Americans, the [attacks on the World Trade Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) in New York (and the attack on the Pentagon and the plane crash in Pennsylvania) affected me greatly. Now that I live in New York I feel even more connected to the events. (Above is a photo I took of downtown NYC last month looking south from the middle of the Manhattan Bridge.)

This September 11th will be the 10th anniversary of the attacks. In remembrance of the event, [Megbomb](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Megbomb) is hosting a [We Will Never Forget postcard swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/96147). The swap instructions:

_&#8220;You will send one postcard to each of your two partners. It would be wonderful for the postcards to be New York themed (handmade is great or store bought) but i will not make the theme a requirement because I want as much participation as possible. On the postcard please share a memory from that tragic event. Where you were, how you heard, if you knew anyone involved. If a postcard is not enough space, you may send a letter IN ADDITION TO the naked postcard that is the swap requirement. Newbies are allowed with well filled out profiles. Experienced swappers must have a 4.90.&#8221;_

The swap is **international** and open for sign up until August 25th. I have joined the swap and look forward to taking a moment to reflect on the terrible, yet important, historic events of September 11th.
