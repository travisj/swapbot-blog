I must be hungry this week, because I have a bunch of recipe links for you, like the delicious S&#8217;mores seen above. Cooking & baking are creative endeavors, too! 

**Food:**

  * You know that I am obsessed with S&#8217;mores and this week I have two delicious links for you&#8230; The photo above is of the [Chai Tea S&#8217;mores recipe from design*sponge](http://www.designsponge.com/2011/09/in-the-kitchen-with-alexis-and-courtneys-chai-tea-smores.html), complete with chai tea, homemade graham crackers. For another twist on the S&#8217;more flavors, try [Bakers Royale&#8217;s S&#8217;more Bars](http://www.bakersroyale.com/bars-and-cookie-bars/smore-bars/).
  * If you are up for frying things, these [Apple Rings](http://www.howto-simplify.com/2011/06/apple-rings.html) look like autumn deliciousness.
  * And, you could serve this [Pumpkin Pie White Hot Chocolate](http://www.closetcooking.com/2009/11/pumpkin-pie-white-hot-chocolate.html) with the apple rings to complete the fall dessert extravaganza!
  * Or, if it is still warm where you are, try these [Snickerdoodle Pumpkin Ice Cream Sandwiches](http://penniesonaplatter.com/2010/10/15/snickerdoodle-pumpkin-ice-cream-sandwiches/).
  * There is a whole lot of butter in this recipe, but I still might have to try it this weekend: [Salted Caramel Chocolate Shortbread Bars](http://annies-eats.net/2011/09/09/salted-caramel-chocolate-shortbread-bars/). Wow!

**Crafts:**

  * This is sort of a food/craft combo: [Amazingly detailed, craft-themed cakes](http://www.cakewrecks.com/home/2011/9/4/sunday-sweets-getting-crafty.html).
  * I really like the [wreath made from loops of scrapbook paper](http://heartlandpaper.typepad.com/heartland_paper/2009/09/autumn-decor-on-studio-5.html) in this fall decor post (at the bottom) on the Heartland Paper blog.
  * I want to try this cute [Crochet Star Pattern](http://foothillhomecompanion.blogspot.com/2011/02/crochet-star-pattern.html). The little start would make sweet holiday ornaments&#8230;
  * Pretty: [a tutorial for jeweled hair pins](http://annekata.blogspot.com/2011/01/tutorial-svarovski-pins.html).
  * Um, ok&#8230; [Felted Berets for Your Cat](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2011/09/felted_berets_for_your_cat.html).
