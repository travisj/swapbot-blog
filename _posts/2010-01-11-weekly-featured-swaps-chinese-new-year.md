Chinese New Year is coming up on February 14th. It is often called the Lunar New Year or Spring Festival and it is one of the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. Next year will be the Year of the Tiger, and in honor of the holiday I have chosen three Chinese New Year swaps to feature this week. (You can read more about the Chinese New Year holiday on . )
