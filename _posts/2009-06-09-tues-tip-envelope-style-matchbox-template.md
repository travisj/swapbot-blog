I am currently in the [Matchbox Backpack on a Dotee](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/34799) swap and decided I wanted to try something a little different for the matchbox &#8211; something that would work well as a tiny backpack. I referred back to a beautiful matchbox sent to me by [ScullyB](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ScullyB) for the [Punch It! matchbox swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3588) back in 2007. The matchbox she sent had a seemingly intricate cover that worked something like an envelope for the little matchbox drawer inside. You can see photos of that matchbox _in action_ above. 

I decided to make something similar for my backpack matchbox and thought I would share a downloadable PDF template with you. (I don&#8217;t quite have my dotee and backpack complete, but I promise to post photos when I do!) 

The inner drawer of this matchbox is exactly the same as my original [Matchbox Template](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2009/03/03/tuesday-tip-rachels-matchbox-template/), but the outer wrap differs significantly. I constructed my outer envelope wrap a little differently than ScullyB, but it gives the same effect. The final matchbox constructed with this template will be about the same size as a standard store-bought 32-count matchbox &#8211; approximately 1.5 x 2 x .5 inches.

[**Download the Envelope-style Matchbox Template PDF here.**](http://static.swap-bot.com/files/enviematchboxtemplate.pdf) 

Here are the basic instructions that are printed on the template: 

  1. Print out template on cardstock at 100%. Do not “fit to paper size” or your matchbox will not be the correct size.
  2. Cut along all black lines; score and fold along all grey lines. 
  3. Apply glue to the light grey areas of the inside drawer.
  4. Fold the sides of the inside drawer in on themselves (they will be end up being double thick) while tucking the tabs into the folds of the shorter sides of the drawer.
  5. Fold the outside wrap around the inside drawer while folding in its bottom and tucking in the tabs. (I suggest test folding the outer wrap around the inner drawer at first, then removing the inside drawer and doing the final fold with glue. This fold is a little tricky as you must tuck in the tabs and the final side.) Glue it in place.
  6. The flap on the right side of the outside wrap template is the matchbox’s envelope closure. Fold it over the top of the box and secure it with a seal or ribbon.
  7. Decorate your matchbox!

_Writing the instructions is the most difficult part of making these templates. I know they are confusing, but try printing the template on regular paper and practicing a few times before tackling the real deal in card stock. Let me know if you have any questions._
