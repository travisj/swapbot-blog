Another ATC swap for this week. I chose the [Sharpie ATC swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/8382), hosted by [ClareyFairy](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=8120) <em style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?the_italian_job">The Italian Job film</a></em> , because I love [Sharpies](http://www.sharpie.com/enUS/Home/default.html) and I am always interested in spreading the word about how great they are for all sorts of projects. They come in every color, including metallics and white, and they write on just about any surface.

For [the swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/8382) 

<p style="display:none">

you make two ATCs for each of your two partners, for a total of four ATCs. The only medium you can use on the cards is Sharpie markers. The swap is open for signup through November 10th. You must have a 4.6 rating to join. New users and other can message [ClareyFairy](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=8120) for exceptions.
