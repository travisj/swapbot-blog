If you like making matchboxes, and you are looking forward to the winter holiday season, the [christmas (fun) time matchbox swap &#8211; ROUND 2](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/24920) (hosted by me, [racheljohnson](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson) ) is perfect for you! The swap is **international** and it is open for signup through November 30th. Each participant has just one partner to whom they send one decorated and filled matchbox. The theme, of course, is the holiday season, but any winter-type themes would also work. I like filling my boxes with stickers, ribbon, brads, buttons, beads, and other little embellishments. Anything goes. However, you must be open to receiving Christmas or winter holiday items in the mail if you join this swap. 

Each participant must have above a 4.7 rating to join. New users are welcome, but I must ban anyone who looks fishy. (A filled out profile is always a plus.) It is a harsh world out there and I want to keep my Christmas fun time swappers safe! 

This should be a really fun swap and I can&#8217;t wait to get started on my matchbox! 

p.s. i angel my matchbox swaps!
