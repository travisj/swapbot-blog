From the website: &#8220;[American Craft Guide](http://www.americancraftguide.com/index.html) is the complete resource for America&#8217;s professional handcrafters and artisans, independent artists, craft hobbyists, and those who love to buy American handcrafted goods. We bring all of these groups together to create a community that fosters learning, sharing, and promoting America&#8217;s handcrafters and artisans.&#8221;

I stumbled on this fairly new (started in July 2008) website today and was really impressed by the site&#8217;s clean layout and its goal of creating a comprehensive arts and craft resource. The site includes a collection of [DIY tutorials](http://www.americancraftguide.com/projects.html), a community section where you can chat with other crafters, an [arts and craft events calendar](http://www.americancraftguide.com/events.html), a [magazine](http://www.americancraftguide.com/magazine.html) (I think that is their word for blog), and soon there will be a [directory of handcrafters and indie artists](http://www.americancraftguide.com/directory.html). It is still a new site and the community only has about 350 members, but it has the potential to be a great resource!
