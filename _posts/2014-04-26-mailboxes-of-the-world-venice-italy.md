The mailboxes in Italy are all about the same, red [Poste Italiane](https://www.poste.it/) boxes, like this one seen in Venice. Many of the mailboxes have graffiti on them, but otherwise, they are nearly identical.

I have mailed quite a few postcards from Italy. But, you guys!! International postcards sent from Italy cost $2 Euro each in postage! Wow. I did not realize it cost almost three times the cost of international postcards from the US. Oh well, snail mail must go on! I bought a LOT of Italian stamps at the Venice post office, like the ones seen below.

I have been taking a photo of every mailbox I see, but many of them in Italy are very similar&#8230;I&#8217;ll be sure to keep you posted on any unique ones I come across!

**Happy snail mailing!!**
