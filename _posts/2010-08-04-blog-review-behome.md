Golda, one of the [Be@Home bloggers](http://pocketchange.become.com/about) recently wrote a very excellent [spotlight article about Swap-bot](http://pocketchange.become.com/2010/07/reinventing-snail-mail-swap-bot-blog.html). I think her description of the &#8216;bot is even better than the ones I write! Thanks, Golda!
