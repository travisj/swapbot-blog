The butterflies will eventually comprise a breath-taking exhibition, currently scheduled for Spring 2014, for all to remember. The Museum has already collected an estimated 900,000 butterflies, but they need more!To contribute to this moving project and exhibit, [TerryF](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TerryF) is hosting her second [**Holocaust Museum Butterfly Project Swap**](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/118253). All Swap-bot users are welcome to join and send as many butterflies as they would like to the co-organizer, [Leashah](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Leashah). To complete the swap, you will also send a postal mail letter to your assigned partner in the swap describing the butterfly you made for the Holocaust Museum and your feelings about the project. The handcrafted butterflies made for this project need to meet a few requirements:   * Butterflies should be no larger than 8 inches by 10 inches.   * Butterflies may be of any medium the artist chooses, but two-dimensional submissions are preferred.  * Glitter and all glitter-related products should not be used.  * Food products (cereal, macaroni, candy, marshmallows or other perishables) also should not be used.Leashah will be photographing the butterflies she receives and posting them on [Flickr here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ourbutterflyproject/). (The butterflies seen above are ones I made for the previous [Butterfly Project Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/40139) in 2009.)Let&#8217;s make this a huge swap and send a giant box of butterflies to the [Holocaust Museum Houston](http://www.hmh.org/ed_butterfly1.shtml)!!&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

So richly, brightly, dazzlingly yellow.
  
Perhaps if the sun’s tears would sing
  
against a white stone&#8230;.
  
Such, such a yellow
  
Is carried lightly ’way up high.
  
It went away I’m sure
  
because it wished
  
to kiss the world good-bye.
  
For seven weeks I’ve lived in here,
  
Penned up inside this ghetto.
  
But I have found what I love here.
  
The dandelions call to me
  
And the white chestnut branches in the court.
  
Only I never saw another butterfly.
  
That butterfly was the last one.
  
Butterflies don’t live in here, in the ghetto.~ Pavel Friedman, June 4, 1942
  
Born in Prague on January 7, 1921.
  
Deported to the Terezin Concentration Camp on April 26, 1942.
  
Died in Auschwitz on September 29, 1944.&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
