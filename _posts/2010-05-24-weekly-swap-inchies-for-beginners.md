  This week&#8217;s featured swap is <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/62768"><b>Inchies for Beginners!</b> 
  
  <div>
    hosted by . Inchies are a lot like Artist Trading Cards (ATCs) in that they are decorated by individual artists and then traded or swapped, but inchies are very small &#8211; only one inch square. For the swap, you will have TWO partners and you will make both partners FOUR inchies each. So you will be making a total of eight inchies in any theme and using any medium. All Swap-bot members are welcome to join this international swap as long as they do not have any unexplained 1 or 3 ratings. Read the full for more info. </p>
