There are just a few more days left to participate in our <a href=http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/10/19/donate-to-the-holiday-gift-drive/">Holiday Gift Drive</a> for [The Partnership for the Homeless.](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5)

I can accept gift cards, warm weather gear, toys, and Paypal donations through the end of this week. The gifts and gift cards we collect will be distributed at The Partnership for the Homeless Children&#8217;s Holiday Party on December 10th, here in New York City. 

For your donation you will receive one rating credit which can be used to remove one low rating from your Swap-bot account. If you don&#8217;t have a low rating now, you can hold onto the credit for future use. **But I must have you donation at Swap-bot HQ by this Friday!**
