I have an awesome announcement&#8230; **2014 was our BIGGEST YEAR EVER for our annual Holiday Gift Donation Drive for [The Partnership for the Homeless](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org)!!!** We collected even more than during our epic [2012 Donation Drive for Hurricane Sandy relief](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2012/12/04/donation-drive-success/)! Wow.

**Together we collected:** 

  * $1250 in Paypal and other cash donations. _(Half of this money was used to purchase H&M and Old Navy gift cards to give to teens at the [Children&#8217;s Holiday Party](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/childrens-holiday-party), as requested by The Partnership. The other half was given directly to The Partnership to offset the party costs and to generally support their programs.)_
  * $485 in varius other gift cards to places like Target and Barnes & Noble.
  * Many hats, gloves, scarves, books, and toys.
  * **115 Swap-bot members participated in the Donation Drive and our grand total was more than $1735!**

I am so impressed with this community&#8217;s generosity year after year! **Thank you all so much for your support and participation!**

Our lovely Partnership contact, Wanda, came and picked up our box of donations today. Our gifts will make a huge impact at the [Children&#8217;s Holiday Party](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/childrens-holiday-party) this Saturday, December 6th. The holiday season will be a little brighter for many of NYC&#8217;s homeless youth thanks to you!

Happy, happy holidays! xoxo
