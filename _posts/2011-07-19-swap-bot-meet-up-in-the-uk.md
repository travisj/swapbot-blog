Last Saturday, July 16th, a group of six UK swap-botters (seen above: [denimblu14](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:denimblu14), [kittenred](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kittenred), [AndrewLips](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:AndrewLips), [Carolinev237](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Carolinev237), [AnnMarie](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:AnnMarie), [hippysherree](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:hippysherree), and [reauk](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:reauk)) met in Sheffield for some in-person swapping and crafting. The event was organized by AndrewLips and he sent this report:

A small but awesome group of members came, mostly made up of Northern based swappers. When we got there, we put together some tables and everyone put on the table the items they had brought for the goodiebags (each person who came got a goodiebag). People brought so many amazing lovely handmade crafts. The goodiebags were stuffed with treats. It felt like Christmas! Even [mum2boys82](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mum2boys82) who could not make the swap sent treats, which was greatly appreciated by the group. </p> 

Shortly after we had our ice breaker where people showed some of their favourite swaps they had received on Swap-bot. After this kittenred did her Woolly Dolly workshop which was lots of fun as well as very simple and easy to do.</i> [Denimblu14 is seen to the left with her Woolly Dolly.] 

_After this a few people had to leave. The rest of us stayed and had lunch together at the pub and then walked around looking at the city of Sheffield. It was so nice to meet everyone who came. We all really enjoyed ourselves. It was clear to see how much Swap-Bot means to all of us, how big a part of our lives it is. It was really nice to see the offline community it has created and put a face to the names. When it was time to leave the sun had come out which was a shame, as we did plan a picnic&#8230; Maybe next time!&#8221;_

It sounds like it was a lovely afternoon! The group says that they are already planning future events. If you are a UK swapper and interested in meeting other Swap-bot members, join the [UK meet up group](http://www.swap-bot.com/group/40829ed09bd8217dd6f1488aa7b0992c/about)!
