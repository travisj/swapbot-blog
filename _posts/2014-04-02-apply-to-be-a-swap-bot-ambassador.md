Do you love Swap-bot? Would you like to help spread the word about our awesome, creative community and help attract other fun, crafty, quality members? **We want YOU to be a Swap-bot Ambassador!**

Swap-bot Ambassadors will be friendly representatives of the &#8216;bot in their local region. They will be armed with (free!) Swap-bot swag to distribute as they see fit. Fun! And they will also be strong, visible members of the community online. Each Swap-bot Ambassador will be introduced on the blog and they will have a special designation graphic on their profile page. Additionally, Swap-bot Ambassadors will have the opportunity to publish guests posts on the blog, and they may also be asked for input on future site design and improvements. Sound exciting?!

**Ambassador Responsibilities:**

  * Have a Swap-bot account that has been active for a year or longer.
  * Be a positive, enthusiastic, active swapper in good standing. (No or very, very few low ratings that can be explained.)
  * Be willing to mail and hand out Swap-bot swag.
  * Be willing to tell friends (in real life and online via social media) about the fun you have swapping.
  * Be open to participating in one-on-one swaps for items from your Ambassador region. (Although, you don&#8217;t have to accept ALL one-on-one swap requests.)

**Ambassador Perks:**

  * A big package of fun Swap-bot swag &#8212; postcards, pins, mini pencils, stickers, etc &#8212; will be mailed directly to you! Send it in your swaps, mail postcards to friends, hand it out around town!
  * Included in the swag will be special Ambassador stickers that you can put on your swap packages.
  * A special Swap-bot Ambassador graphic will be placed on your profile page indicating your status. (Ambassadorships will be life-long appointments! Unless ambassadors wish to resign or they fall into poor standing.)
  * Each Ambassador will be introduced on the Swap-bot blog, with links to their Swap-bot profile page, Twitter, Flickr, blogs, etc.
  * Love and gratitude from your Swap-bot Admins!

**How to Apply:**

Send an email to **rachel -at- swap-bot.com** with the subject: **Swap-bot Ambassador Application**. _(I don&#8217;t want to publish my full email address on the blog as it would attract spammers. Replace -at- with @ to make it a true email address.)_

Include the following info in your email:

  * Your name and Swap-bot username.
  * A photo of yourself that you wouldn&#8217;t mind being published on the Swap-bot blog.
  * A photo of an excellent swap you sent.
  * A description of the region you&#8217;d like to represent. It can be a country, state, or city. Depending on the number of applicants, we may adjust each Ambassador&#8217;s region.
  * How you found Swap-bot, if you can remember!
  * Why you enjoy Swap-bot.
  * Your favorite type of swap.
  * An explanation of any low ratings, if necessary.
  * Any links you&#8217;d like shared on the Swap-bot blog. Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, blogs, websites, etc&#8230;
  * An interesting fact or anecdote about yourself. It can be anything!

I know that is a lot to include in an email, but you have a LONG time to apply. <strike>Send your application email by May 9th.</strike> **Deadline extended to Friday, May 16th!** Ambassadors will be chosen based on region need, the applicant&#8217;s email content, and their swap history. **Ambassadors will be contacted and announced starting in early June.** 

This should be fun! Let me know if you have any questions.

_The Ambassador program was inspired by our very first Swap-bot Ambassador to Portugal, [mariadastrouxes](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:mariadastrouxas). Look for her intro in May!
