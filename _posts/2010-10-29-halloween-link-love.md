The Halloween weekend is finally here! If you haven&#8217;t planned your festivities or costumes yet, here are a few helpful links for last-minute halloweenie projects:

  * Aren&#8217;t those [candy corn jelly bites](http://jelly-shot-test-kitchen.blogspot.com/2010/10/candy-corn-jello-non-alcoholic.html) seen above beautiful?! The recipe can be found on the really amazing blog, [Jelly Shot Test Kitchen](http://jelly-shot-test-kitchen.blogspot.com). Who knew you could make so many cool, bite-size treats with gelatin (i.e. Jell-O)?!
  * [Creative Halloween Snacks and Treats](http://www.pbs.org/parents/kitchenexplorers/2010/10/14/creative-halloween-snacks-and-treats/) on Kitchen Explorers. 
  * These [Melting Witch Cookies](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deathbycupcake/4050073302/in/set-72157622674425354/) (from Jennifer of [Death by Cupcake](http://www.etsy.com/shop/deathbycupcake)) are ingenious and adorable!
  * [No-sew Halloween Costumes](http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/no-sew-costumes) on MarthaStewart.com.
  * This is just fun: [22 Amazing Halloween Costumes From the 80s](http://www.urlesque.com/2010/10/27/halloween-costumes-80s/).
  * [Last-minute, Non-candy Halloween Treats](http://www.tonyastaab.com/2010/10/last-minute-halloween-treats.html) from Tonya Staab. Think coloring pages and crayons instead of more candy&#8230;
  * There may not be time left to do this yourself, but this [Lego Indiana Jones costume](http://www.instructables.com/id/Lego-Indiana-Jones-Costume/) is pretty rad! (Also, adorable [Mythbusters](http://mythbustersresults.com/mythbusters-halloween-costumes).)
  * [Last-minute costumes for your pets](http://www.etsy.com/storque/spotlight/last-minute-halloween-little-monsters-11015/?ref=fp_blog_title) on Etsy.
  * Speaking of pets and costumes, this is just too cute: [Hipster Puppies](http://hipsterpuppies.tumblr.com/).
  * This is my favorite (especially if you are a New Yorker): [16 Easy Costume Ideas in a cute 90 Second Video](http://www.dailycandy.com/all-cities/video/90845/16-Costume-Ideas-in-90-Seconds) on Daily Candy.
  * I think these [beaded spiders on Tatertots and Jello](http://tatertotsandjello.blogspot.com/2010/10/guest-project-make-beaded-spider.html) are pretty &#8211; I think there is still time to make a few!
  * And&#8230; there is a another [Last-Minute Halloween Link Love](http://www.favecraftsblog.com/link-love-last-minute-halloween/) over on the Fave Crafts blog.

Have a spooktakular Halloween!!
