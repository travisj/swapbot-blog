Our hope is that Swap-bot can help facilitate creativity and friendships all around the world, so we LOVE hearing about real life Member meet-ups! 

[Gooseberry](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Gooseberry) sent in this report of a recent meet-up in Georgia:

_A repeat meet-up was enjoyed by swappers [TerryF](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Terryf) and gooseberry. On March 1, 2013, TerryF flew into the Jacksonville, FL airport and was brought back to Georgia by gooseberry. [The friends met up last year in January](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2012/02/16/terryf-and-gooseberry-meet-up/) and had planned for a bit warmer weather this year. This was not to be so, as it was unseasonably cold in Coastal Georgia. TerryF, being Canadian, managed quite well. The same cannot be said for gooseberry. No matter the chill in the air, the friends' hearts were warmed by being able to visit with each other in person once again.</p> 

The next day, on March 2nd, they departed on a 3-hour drive to Middle Georgia to meet up with [Paige1900](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Paige1900) and [DiagonAlley](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:DiagonAlley) at Lane's Packing Plant and peach orchard. Despite a bit of a &#8220;scenic tour&#8221;, TerryF and gooseberry arrived and were greeted with warm hugs on a very cold day. The friends enjoyed lunch at the orchard and Paige1900 treated TerryF and gooseberry to the best peach ice cream in the world. DiagonAlley is more of a chocolate ice cream girl. It's never too cold to enjoy ice cream, whatever the flavor!

TerryF and gooseberry found Paige1900 to be beautiful and just as wonderful in person as she is on Swap-bot. Her daughter, DiagonAlley looks like a carbon copy of her lovely mother and her company was much enjoyed as well.

Plans are already being discussed for more meet-ups between the friends.</i>
