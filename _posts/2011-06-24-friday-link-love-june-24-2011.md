Happy summer! A few sunshine-y links for you this week&#8230;

  * I love the cheerful, felt, citrus coasters seen above. [Get the tutorial on the Purlbee.](http://www.purlbee.com/citrus-coasters/)
  * Another adorable citrus treat: [Margarita and lime sugar cookies.](http://glorioustreats.blogspot.com/2011/06/margarita-cookies-decorating-how-to.html)
  * This seems a bit over-the-top&#8230; but delicious: [Sâ€™mores Cupcake Ice Cream Sandwiches](http://www.52kitchenadventures.com/2011/06/15/smores-cupcake-ice-cream-sandwiches/).
  * Did you know you can design your own iPhone case on [Uncommon](http://www.getuncommon.com/)? Look at the [pretty one created by Melissa on I Still Love You](http://melissaesplin.com/home/2011/06/my-new-iphone-case/).
  * Speaking of iPhones, the Crafts Dept has a [round-up of apps](http://thecraftsdept.marthastewart.com/2011/06/iphone-apps-for-the-organized-crafter.html) to help organize your crafting.
  * Also on the Crafts Dept is a [simple tutorial for making cute flower drinking straws](http://thecraftsdept.marthastewart.com/2011/06/flower-drinking-straws.html) using cupcake liners. Great for a summer party!
  * [Make your own pop-up cards](http://thehairpin.com/2011/06/make-your-own-stationery-pop-up-cards) on one of my fave websites, The Hairpin. 
  * I am not a very skilled knitter, but if I was, I would make this [Cable Braided Necklace](http://olgajazzzy.blogspot.com/2010/12/cable-braided-necklace.html).
  * A little self-promotion: [Read my review of the Teresa Collins Stampmaker on CraftCritique.com.](http://www.craftcritique.com/2011/06/vendor-spotlight-teresa-collins.html)
