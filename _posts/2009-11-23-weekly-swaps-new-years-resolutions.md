During the holiday season things can get hectic and busy, not to mention expensive. Participating in large and complicated swaps may not be feasible for everyone right now, but why not keep up the swapping fun in an easy and inexpensive way? 

I found two simple swaps that are all about our resolutions and plans for 2010: hosted by and hosted by . Both swaps require you to write out your thoughts about next year and send them to your partner. Lexidh&#8217;s swap is and international email swap, and Candyn29&#8217;s swap is an international snail mail letter swap. Please read each swap&#8217;s full descriptions before signing up. 

Also, I know these are not the only New Year-themed swaps out there. Please leave a comment with a link to any other similar swaps you find.
