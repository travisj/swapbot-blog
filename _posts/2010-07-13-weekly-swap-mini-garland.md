I just love party decorations, especially garland (or bunting). It can make any space more festive! 

So, this week I am featuring the [Mini Garland Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/66713) hosted by [Wanda](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Wanda). The international swap is so cute and clever. Each participant creates a mini, two-foot long garland for their one partner. The garland can be of any theme or style &#8211; sender&#8217;s choice. It can have a message, like [Wanda&#8217;s seen above](http://www.flickr.com/photos/28821647@N00/4765144270/), or it can be plain. Each garland must contain at least twelve pennants and they must be made of something sturdier than text weight paper. 

The [Mini Garland Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/66713) is only open for sign up through the 19th, so head over and read the full description if you are interested! The swap is open to international swappers with over a 4.5 rating and you&#8217;ll have until August 2nd to send your garland.
