A very random assortment of links for you today:

  * A bunch of people have asked for this, so here is the [template](http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/mirkwooddesigns/matchbox.htm) from Mirkwood Designs that I use to make matchboxes out of cardstock.
  * I know we have a lot of cat lovers on Swap-bot, and if you do not already know about the site [ICanHasCheezBurger.com](http://icanhascheezburger.com/) you are missing out on the best LOLcats. So funny!
  * Liquid Paper&#8217;s [pom pom pumpkins tutorial](http://liquidpaper.typepad.com/liquid_paper/2007/10/tutorial-pom-po.html)

  
    is just too cute for words. I am not sure what you do with the mini pumpkins when you are done, but I don&#8217;t care.</li> 
    
      * My partner in my [christmas (fun) time matchbox swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/8173) is _definitely_ going to be getting some of these adorable [Making Memories &#8220;Deck the Halls&#8221; chipboard buttons](http://twopeasinabucket.kaboose.com/shopping.asp?product_id=57711) in their matchbox. I love those things!</ul> 
    
    Have a great weekend! xoxo
