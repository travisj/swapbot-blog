September is nearing its end &#8212; pure craziness, but it is true! My link line up is a little lean this week, but I think you&#8217;ll enjoy it anyway&#8230;

  * My sweet tooth seems to be in control of my blogging brain lately&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t resist sharing the how-to for these [Cotton Candy and Chocolate Ganache Macarons!](http://lifesafeast.blogspot.com/2010/09/cotton-candy-macarons.html)
  * [Glow-in-the-dark Glitter!](http://www.craftcritique.com/2010/09/martha-stewart-glow-in-dark-glitter.html) Perfect for Halloween crafts!
  * I plan to make these [Doughnut Muffins](http://www.howto-simplify.com/2010/08/muffin-donuts.html) this weekend. Yes, Doughnut muffins!
  * [CrusherDog](http://twitter.com/crusherdog) could [write his own tweets?!](http://mashable.com/2010/02/13/tweeting-dog-collar/)
  * An informal survey: If you are a Twitter user, what type of content would you like to see shared by the [SwapbotNews](http://twitter.com/SwapbotNews) twitter account? For that matter, what would you like to see more of on the blog?

Please add more links in the comments&#8230; I feel like I must have missed some good stuff this week!
