Work is underway for both swap categories and swap partner rating. Categorization takes on a higher priority because the number of current swaps is getting out of control. Just take a look at the [View all swaps](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/search.php) page to see what I mean. It is becoming difficult to keep track of the swaps you are interested in. 

We are going to come up with a list of about 10 categories and then allow each swap to belong to a maximum of 3 categories. From the swap search page, then, you will be able to search for swaps based on the category. Pretty simple stuff. Should be rolled out to Swap-bot sometime this coming week.

As for partner rating, we are making progress on that as well. It might be in place as early as next weekend. I&#8217;m noting making any promises, we&#8217;ll see&#8230;
