I gathered up quite a few links for you this week! The list is a bit heavy on the food category&#8230; I guess I was feeling hungry this week! ha!

**Crafty Stuff:**

[<img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/snailmailmyemail.jpg" alt="" title="snailmailmyemail" width="470" height="209" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8329" srcset="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/snailmailmyemail-300x133.jpg 300w, http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/snailmailmyemail.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" />](http://snailmailmyemail.org/)

  * I love this idea: [Snail Mail My Email](http://snailmailmyemail.org/) &#8211; It is a &#8220;month-long (July 15 &#8211; August 15), interactive community art project which seeks to both share the warm-fuzzy feeling of receiving a personalized letter as well as inspire people to send their own snail mail. In a culture overrun with instant gratification and on-demand services, this project cultivates appreciation for the lost art of letter writing.&#8221; You email them with a message and the address of your intended recipient. Their group of volunteers write out your message it and mail it! Very cool.
  * [Make a tiny granny square necklace](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2011/07/make-a-tiny-granny-square-necklace-home-made-simple-gift-ideas/) on Dollar Store Crafts.
