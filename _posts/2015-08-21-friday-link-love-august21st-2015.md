Gah. Summer is almost over??! I know it is said all too often, but man, time flies!! I&#8217;ve barely had time to gather up these fun and funky links for you&#8230; but I did. Enjoy!

  * These [Freezer Paint Popsicles](http://www.hellowonderful.co/post/MAKE-FREEZER-PAINT-POPSICLES) would be such a fun (outdoor) summer art project for kids!
  * [How to do a packaging tape image transfer](http://diycandy.com/2015/08/how-to-do-a-packaging-tape-image-transfer/), plus cute greeting card ideas on DIY Candy.
  * For the crocheters: [these superhero finger puppets are amazingly cute.](http://krawka.blogspot.com.es/2015/01/its-bird-its-plane-no-its-finger.html)
  * I NEED to have a party so that I can make one of these awesome, beautiful, sparkly [unicorn pi√±atas](http://ohhappyday.com/2015/08/unicorn-pinata-makeover/)! 
  * [Eight cute and easy DIY pencil pouches to welcome back-to-school season.](http://www.hellowonderful.co/post/8-CUTE-AND-EASY-DIY-PENCIL-POUCHES-TO-RING-IN-BACK-TO-SCHOOL)
  * A pretty blog: [Flax & Twine.](http://www.flaxandtwine.com)
  * Woah. This awesome [NYC-themed washi tape](https://www.etsy.com/listing/242000299/2015-mt-summer-collection-artist-series?ref=fp_item&aref=46996917212) must be mine!!
  * How far can a recipe stray from the original three-ingredient recipe and still be considered a S&#8217;more?? I am not sure, but I&#8217;d still try these [Reese&#8217;s S&#8217;mores Chocolate Cookies](http://www.somethingswanky.com/reeses-smores-chocolate-cookies/) and the [S&#8217;mores Coffee Milkshake](http://www.shugarysweets.com/2015/06/smores-coffee-milkshake).
