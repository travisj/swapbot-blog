From the swap description:

_&#8220;Let&#8217;s Upcycle any type of tin or cardboard container into something functional and beautiful.</p> 

You will have one partner and redesign and decorate either one cardboard, plastic, or tin container and send to your assigned swap partner.

Non-Profile Specific &#8212; No need to wait for assigned partners, go ahead and start on your container upscycle project and you&#8217;ll be ready to send once your partner is assigned.

You may cut your container, alter it into anything you can imagine and decorate with fabric, felt, decorative scrapbooking paper, vintage images, stamped and cut out images, etc.&#8221; </i>

Such a fun a creative idea! Plus, who couldn&#8217;t use a pretty, new container for organizing craft supplies! [Sign up before May 14th](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/85090) and then get started on your upcycled container.
