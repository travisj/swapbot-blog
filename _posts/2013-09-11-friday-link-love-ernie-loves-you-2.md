I am giddy over all of these Ernie crafts! [FunnerKimberley](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:FunnerKimberley) made this felt envelope Ernie for the [Ernie the Envie Inspired Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/154162) last month. So cute!

I can’t top these awesome Ernie crafts with links, but here are a few anyway…
