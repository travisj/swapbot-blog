Thank you to all 71 of you who entered our [Pipsticks sponsored giveaway](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2016/07/03/check-it-out-pipsticks-subscription-for-sticker-lovers.html)! I know you are anxious to find out which two lucky commenters won the awesome Pipsticks Studio Sticker Prize Packs. I used [Random.org](https://www.random.org/) to select the two winners... and without further ado... the winners are:

**[froggy2974](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:froggy2974) & [thismeAXiD](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:thismeAXiD)**

Congratulations! Your prize packs will be mailed directly from Pipsticks.
