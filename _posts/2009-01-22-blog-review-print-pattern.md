If you enjoy any type of graphic or textile design you will love [print & pattern](http://printpattern.blogspot.com/) , a prolific design blog that &#8220;celebrates the world of surface pattern design&#8221; and collects all types of printed design images. It is updated multiple times per day with up-close, color images of fun patterns and printed greeting card designs. You can always go to [print & pattern](http://printpattern.blogspot.com/) to find new inspiration for all types of crafts and design ideas! I visit everyday just to keep up with the trends and to see what is out there in the commercial design world. Many of the posts are organized by a theme (like [sausage dogs](http://printpattern.blogspot.com/2009/01/print-theme-sausage-dogs.html) ), but often new designers or brands are featured. There are so many images and so many posts &#8212; the blog was started in March 2006 &#8212; that you are sure to find a pattern or design that you love on [print & pattern](http://printpattern.blogspot.com/)!
