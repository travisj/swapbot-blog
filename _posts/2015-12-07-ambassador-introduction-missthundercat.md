It has taken me much longer than I would have liked to introduce all 29 of our Ambassadors &#8212; but this is the final Intro!! Yay! The Ambassadors are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities. If you are interested in representing Swap-bot in your area and sending out Swap-bot swag, stay tuned for info about our upcoming second round of Ambassador applications happening in January._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [MissThundercat](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MissThundercat)!** 

**Ambassador Region:** The Netherlands

I am not going to say that I saved the best for last (because I think all of our Ambassadors are the best!) but MissThundercat is definitely a very special Swap-bot member and Ambassador. She is an Original Member who has been swapping on the &#8216;bot since March of 2007. She has completed more that 500 swaps and often posts about Swap-bot and snail mail on social media. A truly avid snail mailer and crafter, she loves hand-carving stamps, coloring, calligraphy with fountain pens, ATCs, and many other types of art and crafts. MissThundercat holds a special place in my heart because in 2010 I had the privilege of [meeting her in real life while she was visiting NYC](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/06/17/swapper-meet-ups/) &#8212; such fun!!

**How MissThundercat found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I found swapbot through a friend of mine on flickr who introduced me to matchbox swaps.&#8221; 

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I&#8217;ve met a lot of fun people through Swap-bot, and met a few of them in real life, as well. A recent one is my friend [Orit](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Orit) from Israel, I met last year in October. And that&#8217;s the main reason why I love swapbot, it brings a lot of crafty people together on and off line.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;I love doing themed swaps, especially Matchbox swaps, ATC&#8217;s, and Mail Art (I did a [365 Mail art project](http://mailart365.blogspot.nl/search/label/Miss%20Thundercat) in 2012/2013 and sent out many RAKs to swapbot members through a signup in the forums). Crafty swaps are my favorite kind. [This is one of the fave things I&#8217;ve sent](https://www.flickr.com/photos/miss_thundercat/5731574206/in/set-72157601419616865) &#8212; combining my love for stamp carving and matchbox swaps.&#8221;
