This week I am featuring a unique mail art swap, but you must sign up soon! The deadline for the is this Friday, January 1st! The swap is being hosted by and she explains the requirements very well in the swap description:

_Take a piece of paper (the size and color is up to you) and on one side fill it with all the things you want to rid yourself of in the new year, like emotional distresses, love problems, self esteem issues, etc, or focus on one large issue. Scrible, draw, list, collage, paint, etc. Then on the other side, write many positive things you want to acomplish in the new year. You dont need to have either of these in paragraph form, you should just write whatever comes to mind, even if its only two or three large words and a bunch of doodles! When youve done this, fold the envelope up with the negative things you want to rid yourself of in the inside,where nobody can see it, and with the positive things facing outside . Inside this envelope you can put small things that relate to what you want to get rid of, like old bills, a picture of a past lover, a photo of someone who you cannot stand, or even small objects that relate, like maybe a small wooden heart, etc.. Then seal the envelope. On the outside, make sure to write your username, because your partner will not even open the envelope!! They will rate you, then burn it to ash after reading the positive things written on the outside!! This swap is for YOUR gain. The more you believe in the power of attraction, and the more you believe that you make your own destiny, the more likely this is to work for you! Think of it as mail art, but with a purpose!_

You send your 2010 envelope to just one partner by the January 7th deadline. You must have a 4.9 rating, or higher, to join the . Happy New Year!
