I really wish there was a picture to go along with this week&#8217;s featured swap, because when I read the title I literally shrieked out loud! The [Matchbox Backpack on a Dotee swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/34799), hosted by [Charrley](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Charrley), sounds like it will be a ton of adorable fun. For the swap, each participant creates a Dotee Doll of any theme for their one partner. They then alter a 32-count matchbox to be a tiny backpack for the doll. The &#8220;backpack&#8221; must contain at least five craft items that the recipient can use in future projects. The swap is international and you must sign up before May 24th. 

Dotee Dolls are small fabric dolls created by Dorothy &#8220;Dot&#8221; Christian. They are meant to spread friendship, love, and joy. For more info about Dotee Dolls, [check out their creator, Dot&#8217;s, blog](http://dotslifeandart.blogspot.com/2008/01/dotee-doll-fervour.html). You can also see lots of great photos of the dolls in the [Dotee Doll Flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/doteedolls/). View the [Matchbox Crafts Flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/matchboxcrafts/) to see lots of inspirational altered matchboxes. I can&#8217;t wait to see photos from the [Matchbox Backpack on a Dotee swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/34799) in those Flickr groups!!
