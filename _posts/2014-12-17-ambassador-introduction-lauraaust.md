They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [LauraAust](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:LauraAust)!** LauraAust lives near Des Moines, Iowa, and she has been swapping on Swap-bot for more than four years. She is nearing one thousand 5 ratings and she loves rainbows and bubbles!

**Ambassador Region:** Iowa, USA

**How LauraAust found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I was wanting to swap inchies and found Swap-Bot while looking for a way to do just that.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I enjoy &#8216;meeting&#8217; all of the people and interacting with them. Some of them are so nice! I have met a couple in real life – that was very exciting. I can say that I have found couple of my NEW best friends on Swap-Bot. I am co-founder of [REACH FOR SUCCESS](http://www.swap-bot.com/group/d1de56876f9785efec84e2d0744194e8/about) and it’s great to see how supportive members can be! Swap-Bot has encouraged me to try a few new things. And, it always seems I can find a swap in which I wish to participate – if not, I just create one myself!&#8221; 

&#8220;Before Swap-Bot I had never heard of Kawaii – now I have a pretty impressive collection. I also learned about Zentangles here!&#8221;

&#8220;I enjoy trying to help out others when they are looking for items, products, or needing help / input / advice on a project. I really like turning people on to new crafts – I recently got my Swap-Bot friend addicted to paper / foundation piecing (quilting)! Yay!! I like to consider myself a &#8216;helper&#8217; although others call me an &#8216;enabler&#8217;.&#8221;

&#8220;I also love that we can help each other out in daily life issues like depression, death of a family member, child raising issues, etc.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;It varies on the day! I used to do a lot of ATCs, inchies and twinchies, rolos – mostly paper crafts. Then I was doing some crocheting swaps. I love to swap fabric! Lately I have been doing monthly weight loss journals. I also really like to do private swaps when I see something on someone’s profile or Flickr that is incredible – usually I can find something to swap with them to get it! For example, I once crocheted a “naked” doll for my partner to accessorize – in trade she made watercolor paintings of my four cats. I’ve also sent a large crocheted afghan in exchange for a Blythe doll (I named her Meredith and she sits on our TV stand).&#8221; 

**Check out LauraAust&#8217;s crocheted Dotee doll goddess made for a profile based swap:**

**Interesting facts about LauraAust:** 

  * &#8220;I was a finalist in a Better Homes and Gardens Patchwork and Quilting design contest in 2001 – the theme was “State Fair”. My quilt toured the country for a year and I got my name in the magazine and a photo of my quilt on their website. I also got a really nice box of prizes valued at $250+.&#8221;
  * &#8220;I own enough quilting fabric to open my own shop (but continue to add to it).&#8221; (See photo below!)
