I am very excited to announce another great sponsored giveaway!

They have all sorts of amazing photo jewelry supplies that can help you make everything from bracelets and necklaces to cufflinks and rings &#8212; all with your own photos! Their jewelry has even been featured on the [Today show](http://www.photojewelrymaking.com/todayshowphotojewelry.aspx) as a great gift idea. Very cool!
