They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**How LadyRose found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember. I joined back in 2008!&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I love meeting new people and it&#8217;s a lot of fun!&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;I love postcard swaps.&#8221; _LadyRose prefers swaps that are less art and craft intensive, like mail and electronic swaps._

**Interesting facts about LadyRose:** &#8220;I am an [autograph collector](http://sheilasautographs.co.nr) and am always interested in swapping for autographs. I love New Kids on the Block and dolphins.&#8221;
