&#8230; and a few problems.

We spent some time working on Swap-bot over the weekend and we made some improvements/changes:

  * The most important change is that we extended the login time. Which means you can now stay on Swap-bot for up to twelve hours without being automatically logged off. Sweet!
  * We made many more opportunities to see a member&#8217;s profile. For example, member names on the partner info pages and on the Forums now link to their profile.
  * Lastly, we re-ordered the ratings on everyone&#8217;s profile and added the date that each rating was given. Unfortunately, this change has caused a few bugs. We hope to have it totally fixed by tonight, but until then some of you ratings may be missing and some of the rating dates may say 1999, which is not correct. Please be patient. Everything will be fixed (and better than ever) shortly!

We are continuing to make changes and improvements to Swap-bot, but there are bound to be a few growing pains. Please bear with us and continue to keep us informed of any errors or glitches you see on the site. Some of the other changes we hope to implement in the next few weeks: Improved messaging system with a &#8220;Sent Messages&#8221; box, greater search capabilities for swaps and perhaps member profiles, and an organized system for viewing information about coordinators. Fun!
