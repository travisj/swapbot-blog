Winter is coming! _(The photo above is me and Crusher last December, but I thought it conveyed the right winter feelings&#8230;)_ 

If you are sure to be doing some winter crafting, join this week&#8217;s featured swap &#8211; [the Mini Inspiration Winter Kit Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76006) &#8211; and refresh your craft supplies. The international swap is hosted by [1Scrapper](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:1Scrapper) and it is only open for sign up through the end of the week (November 20th). For the swap, you send you one partner a small pack of winter-themed craft items. Your &#8220;mini inspiration kit&#8221; should include about ten unique items and have a value of approximately $8. Be creative with your items (don&#8217;t just send ten buttons) and package everything in a sweet way &#8212; wrapped and tied with ribbon or placed in a wintery box. The kits must be mailed by December 1st so that everyone gets them in time for winter crafting. 

Check out the [the Mini Inspiration Winter Kit Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76006) description for more info.
