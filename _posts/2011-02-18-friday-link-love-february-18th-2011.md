I took an unintended hiatus from blog posting this week. I hope you are not in despair over the lack of swappy goodness! The good news is that I am back with a stellar Friday Link Love!

  * Many of us in the USA have Monday off work in honor of the President&#8217;s Day holiday and why not commemorate the occasion with a presidential craft?! [Learn how to make the cute mini president figurines seen above on the Etsy&#8217;s blog.](http://www.etsy.com/storque/how-to/how-tuesday-mini-president-figurines-12333/)
  * Check out these two lovely craft blogs I discovered during the [Crafterminds tweet-up](http://crafterminds.com/crafterminds/) this week: [**The Casabella Project**](http://casabellaproject.com/) & [**Nethering Our Fest**](http://neatheringourfest.blogspot.com/). (You can join in on the Crafterminds chat on Twitter ever Monday at 4 pm EST by following the [#crafterminds](http://tweetchat.com/room/crafterminds) tag.)
  * Fortune favors the brave&#8230; and the crafty! I love this [DIY glitter garland on Creature Comforts](http://www.creaturecomfortsblog.com/home/2011/2/16/my-diy-weekend.html).
  * [Use this pattern on Kat Crafts to crochet adorable flying pigs with golden wings.](http://kat-knits.blogspot.com/2011/02/iron-craft-challenge-7-if-i-were-pig-id.html)
  * This time of year I use a lot of tissues for my runny nose, so I really want to make one of these cute [&#8220;tissue monsters&#8221; on Better Together.](http://wraysist3rs.blogspot.com/2011/02/making-colds-fun.html) Kids would love to carry around tissues in a monster pouch!
  * I like these clever [Twitter and technology inspired greeting cards](http://thecraftsdept.marthastewart.com/2011/02/paperwheel-press.html) from PaperWheel press featured on The Crafts Dept.
  * One of my favorite illustrators, Lynn of Jinjerup, created some totally lovable [animal gift boxes](http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/2011/02/cute-animal-gift-box-buy-3-get-1-free.html) that you can print, fold, and share&#8230; and she is giving a few away!
