Many of you noticed that Swap-bot was acting sluggish over the last week. Also, most of the email alerts have not been getting sent. Today, we are working on correcting those issues, as well as improving things on the backend which will help the site run faster.

You may have already noticed some weird things happening today and there may continue to be some short outages. Our plan is to have everything corrected and improved by the end of the day. We are sorry for any confusion. Thank you for sticking with us!
