They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

Meet our next Ambassador, [ColoradoKate](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:ColoradoKate)! ColoradoKate has been a Swap-bot member since 2011 and she has completed more than 240 swaps. She loves kawaii, postcards, and tea! 

**Ambassador Region:** USA &#8211; Colorado

**How ColoradoKate found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I found Swap-bot when I started looking for penpals! I had just watched the BBC&#8217;s Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice, and I wanted to write more letters!&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;Swap-bot is a place where I&#8217;ve made some very faithful friends and penpals &#8211; people who&#8217;ve stuck with me through my pregnancy hiatus!&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;My favorite swaps are letter swaps with beautiful stationery, hand cancelled stamps, and something real to say.&#8221; 

**One of ColoradoKate&#8217;s most excellent sent swaps:** &#8220;It was a Kawaii sticker flakes, matchbox, and surprise swap. I sent a little box of Apollo candy and some acrylic nails I decorated myself. I don&#8217;t only do Kawaii though, so I&#8217;ve also included a Small Denominations Stamps on an Envelope swap I did. I was sending to Canada, so I sent the full complement of USPS American Design stamps. Those rubber stamps I used were hand carved by another Swap-bot member!&#8221; _(Both swaps seen below)_

**Interesting facts about ColoradoKate:** &#8220;I love hot springs and onsen-style Japanese baths, but I never take baths at home!&#8221;
