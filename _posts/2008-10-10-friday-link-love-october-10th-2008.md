Hello autumn! The Swap-bot blog is back in business! Enjoy this eclectic list of fun links:

  * I&#8217;ve got to share it one more time, here is the [podcast interview](http://www.wsradio.com/internet-talk-radio.cfm/shows/Terri-O-Radio:-Empowering-Creativity/archives/date/selected/09-25-2008.html) about Swap-bot that I did with TerriO on her &#8220;Empowering Creativity&#8221; radio show. We talked about some general swapping info and about how to use Swap-bot.
  * If you are getting pumped for October 31st, you must check out [Martha Stewart&#8217;s Halloween Workshop](http://www.marthastewart.com/halloween-workshop-week5). There are tons of recipes and craft projects, including [free clip art downloads](http://www.marthastewart.com/portal/site/mslo/menuitem.3a0656639de62ad593598e10d373a0a0/?vgnextoid=2f7f84d26e194110VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default&lnc=c4338f416b86b110VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD). You can even sign up to get the [Halloween Idea of the Day](http://www.marthastewart.com/halloween-idea-of-the-day?sDate=20081010) sent to you by email. Gotta love Martha! 
  * Have I linked to this before? [BAM POP!](http://www.bampop.com/) One of my very favorite scrapbooking supply designers. Robots with parachutes and little ninjas and unicorns &#8211; too cute!
  * A political crafting project blog: [Crafting for Change](http://sewer-sewist.com/obamacraftproject/)
  * Not exactly a crafting resource, but definitely inspiring and educational: [The Writer&#8217;s Almanac with Garrison Keillor](http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/). Each day there is a short podcast with info about authors, quick literary facts, and a poem all read in Keillor&#8217;s soothing voice. You can listen to the show each day on public radio or online, or read the content on the blog.
