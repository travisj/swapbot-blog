Like all of us, my heart is broken over the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut. I am terribly sad and confused and at a loss for what to say and how to help. 

Pediatric psychologist ([and DIY blogger](http://www.damasklove.com/)) Amber Daigre has an idea for how we can put our craftiness to work helping the Newtown community. She has organized the [**Drawn Together project**](http://www.damasklove.com/drawn-together-a-fundraiser-for-newtown-connecticut/) and is assembling creative kits for the [Newtown Youth & Family Services Center](http://www.newtownyouthandfamilyservices.org/) and you can help! 

The kits will contain art supplies and handmade greeting cards, and they will be used by counselors working with children from the community. You can donate supplies, money, or a handmade, child-friendly &#8220;thinking of you&#8221; card. [Get all of the details about Drawn Together here.](http://www.damasklove.com/drawn-together-a-fundraiser-for-newtown-connecticut/)
