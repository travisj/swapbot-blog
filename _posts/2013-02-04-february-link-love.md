Good Monday to you! A few of you may noticed that we had a little trouble with the blog over the weekend, but everything is back in working order now, and I am happy to share the many fun links I&#8217;ve gathered over the last week&#8230; 

Valentine&#8217;s Day is coming up in a little over a week! Are you ready?
