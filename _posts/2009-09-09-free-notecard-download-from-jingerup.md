Remember Jingerup, that really cute design & craft website? Well, Lynn (the talented designer behind all of the amazing illustrations) has another free download and tutorial to share: [Mr & Mrs Byrd Invitations](http://jinjerup.blogspot.com/2009/09/freebie-of-week-mr-mrs-byrd-invitation.html). They are super-cute folded notecards that &#8220;are great for any sort of message too, please do feel free to use them as note cards, mini greeting cards or just to say hi!&#8221;
