Happy second day of 2009! I think this year is going to be a good one. One of my resolutions is to be more crafty in 2009. Here are some links that I think will help with that goal:

  * Interesting article: Despite the recession, [Craft sales are actually up!](http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/23/business/23craft.php)
  * This podcast is two years old, but it is still relevant: [Crafty New Year&#8217;s Resolutions](http://www.craftypod.com/2006/12/28/craftypod-41-crafty-new-years-resolutions/) from CraftyPod.
  * Also, [10 New Year&#8217;s Resolutions for a Crafty Person.](http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/112010/10_new_years_resolutions_for_a_crafty.html?cat=24)
  * Want to try making something new this year? Try this tutorial for [how to make your own rub-on transfers.](http://www.rubberstampingfun.com/rna.html) 
  * Are resolutions not really your thing? CraftStylish suggests [keeping track of your &#8220;I dids&#8221; instead of your &#8220;To dos.&#8221;](http://www.craftstylish.com/item/34838/start-with-a-clean-slate-in-2009-resolve-to-keep-a-list-of-your-i-dids-instead-of-to-dos)
