Valentine's Day is still more than a month away, but it is my favorite holiday, so I want to get started early! Do you like Valentines and paper crafting? Join my [February Love Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/137276). It is the fifth annual edition of the swap and I'd love for it to be huge! New and experienced swappers are welcome.

To help get us in the hearts and kisses mood, check out some of my favorite Valentines picks from [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/):
