The evening was spent crafting, of course! Tarabell150 brought bottle caps and the necessary tools to show everyone how to make bottle cap buttons, which they painted with alcohol inks. Loricritt supplied the necessities to make glass pendants, and there was also a &#8220;show and tell&#8221; of ATCs, Skinnys, Inchies, Dotees, and Button Fairies. Sounds like a fun afternoon!
