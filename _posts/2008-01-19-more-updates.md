I have a few updates to tell you about&#8230;

1 &#8211; &#8220;Your Swaps&#8221; has been changed to &#8220;My Swaps&#8221;. It is just a word change and the link still goes to the same page. It is a change which lays the ground work for the site to be consistent as we add features in future.

2 &#8211; We have implemented a new user swap sign up limit. All new users of Swap-bot now start with a five swap limit. They can only sign up for five active swaps at a time at first. This limit lasts until they have received three positive (5) ratings from their swap partners. Once they have received three positive ratings, the swap sign up limit is completely removed and they can sign up for as many swaps as they would like. This is the first time we have implemented any type of swap limit, so we may make adjustments as we receive feedback. Also, this new feature is not retroactive. 

3 &#8211; Swap-bot Groups are slowly being tested and released. To learn about being a group beta tester [go here](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/6077)

. There will be much more info about groups provided once we get closer to officially releasing the system. They will basically be a way to organize swapping and chatting among communities with similar interests. Any members with over five &#8220;5&#8221; ratings will be able to create groups, and each group will have a home page, private forum, and group-only swaps. Pretty cool. We are excited about the possibilities!

4 &#8211; The [FAQ page]((http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php) <em style="display:none"><a href="http://www.turtlesurvival.org/?jumper">Jumper full</a></em> is constantly being updated, so check it out when you have questions. If you don't see your question there, please let me know so that we can add it. 

Ok, that is about it for now&#8230; but stay tuned for info and announcements about GROUPS!
