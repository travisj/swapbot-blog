It is hard to believe that 2011 is nearly upon us! Holiday celebrating has cut into my blogging time over the last few weeks, but I have a special featured swap for you this week:

**[2011 Postcard swap #1 &#8211; January](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74177)**

This is your chance to get in on a year-long swap series at the very beginning! This international swap series is hosted by [Angellica](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:angellica) and it is open to new users. The swap is a quick and simple postcard swap: send one store-bought, &#8220;sender&#8217;s choice&#8221; postcard to your one partner. 

The [2011 Postcard swap #1 &#8211; January](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74177) is currently in the number one spot of the &#8220;Top Swaps&#8221; list with 220 participants, but if you want to participate, join now!! The swap closes for sign up tomorrow, the last day of 2010.

Happy New Year!
