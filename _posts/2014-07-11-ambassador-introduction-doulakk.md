They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities.

**How doulakk found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I found SB by searching on Google after searching for an online swapping site with reputable members.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;I enjoy SB because it allows me to make art and share my collection of ephemera. I have also tried painting, stamping and gelli plates because of SB, so it helps me to open my mind to other aspects of my new found love for art, in general.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;My favorite type of swap would have to be sending and receiving Envies full of Ephemera for journaling. I equally love sending ATC&#8217;s. On a side note, I love hosting tags and games and RAK&#8217;s in my group&#8217;s forum, [Paper on Steroids](http://www.swap-bot.com/group/ae8c05222f2d56b64b0a6caa6eb62670/about).&#8221;

**Check out these examples of doulakk&#8217;s mail art and ATC swaps:**

**Interesting facts about doulakk:**

  * &#8220;I hate stinkbugs and capture them in my craft room in a bottle of water that sits next to me. Is that mean?&#8221;
  * &#8220;I am scared of canned biscuits, so I don&#8217;t buy them. Ever.&#8221;
  * &#8220;The only thing that I wanted from my Grandmother&#8217;s home after she passed was her mop. HER. MOP.&#8221;
  * &#8220;I am a childbirth doula and breastfeeding peer counselor and love empowering women in their roles as mothers.&#8221;
  * &#8220;I am a &#8216;Headmistress&#8217; for a private school. Scandalous.&#8221;
  * &#8220;I have recently started crafting, that being 3 years ago, and feel extremely lucky to have found a niche in the art world.&#8221;

_I hope you liked our second Ambassador interview and introduction. I don&#8217;t know how doulakk finds time to do it all &#8212; doula, headmistress, crafter, Ambassador &#8212; but I am glad she does! Contact her if you are interested in any USA paper craft swaps._
