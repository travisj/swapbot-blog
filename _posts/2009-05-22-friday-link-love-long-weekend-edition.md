Some early evening link love to get you through the long holiday weekend. Have fun!

  * The image above is from a [Button Fairy Tutorial](http://www.flickr.com/photos/redwing480/sets/72157603782633768/) on Flickr created by Swap-bot user, [redwing480](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:redwing480) . The tutorial is very detailed and quite handy for anyone who is curious about the cute little fairies. (I need to add &#8220;Button Fairy&#8221; to the glossary!!)
  * There is a very sweet (and FREE) [scalloped tag download](http://aprintaday.blogspot.com/2009/05/downloads-tags-stickers-and-notepad.html) on A Print A Day.
  * I just ordered some washi paper masking tape from [nothingelegant&#8217;s Etsy store](http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=6890685) and it is beyond beautiful &#8211; had to share the store! (I originally found out about nothingelegant on [simplesong](http://simplesong.typepad.com/home/2009/05/etsy-love-nothing-elegant.html) .)
  * Ok, I saw the new [Star Trek movie](http://www.startrekmovie.com/) recently and I am in love!! (Usually, I am more of a [Next Generation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_The_Next_Generation) girl, but I am digging this newest interpretation.) Anyhoo, if you are also a Trekkie, you must check out the two Star Trek ATC swaps going on now: [here](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/37612) & [here](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/37612) .
  * [Amy Butler](http://www.amybutlerdesign.com/mainmenu.php) is holding a contest &#8211; make something with her Midwest Modern fabric and submit an email with a photo of your creation between June 1st and September 15th. Ten winners will receive a very generous Amy Butler prize package. Read the official contest PDF [here](http://www.amybutlerdesign.com/pdfs/MidMod_Contest.pdf). (found via [Whip Up](http://whipup.net/2009/05/22/amy-butler-contest/))
  * This next one is just for fun, because hey, it is a holiday weekend and you just might be taking some family photos: [Awkward Family Photos](http://awkwardfamilyphotos.com/).
