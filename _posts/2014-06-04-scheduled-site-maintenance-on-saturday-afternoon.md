Hello! Due to some much-needed site maintenance, Swap-bot will experience some downtime this Saturday afternoon. The site will most likely not be accessible starting at about 5 pm EST on Saturday, June 7th. It could be down for up to three hours. We are sorry for the inconvenience and we will try to minimize the amount of downtime as much as possible. Please plan accordingly for your swaps and let me know if you have any questions.
