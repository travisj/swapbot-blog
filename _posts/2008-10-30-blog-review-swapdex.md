Swap-bot was originally created to give bloggers a tool to help them host successful swaps with their users. Even though many swaps are hosted on Swap-bot every month, there are still lots of bloggers hosting independent swaps on their sites. How does a potential swapper find out about all of these independent swaps? Check out the [SwapDex](http://swapdex.blogspot.com/)! The SwapDex is an index of current swaps going on all over the internet. (If you participate in any of the independent swaps and notice the hosts are overwhelmed with the organizational part of swapping, definitely spread the word about Swap-bot! We always want more dedicated swappers to join the &#8216;bot!) SwapDex is run by [Jenna Z](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:JennaZ), a friend of Swap-bot and a dedicated blogger. Check out her personal blog, [CorgiPants](http://corgipants.blogspot.com/), where she shares her everyday craftiness and cute photos of her pups. She also has a great index of [Tutorials](http://corgipants.blogspot.com/2007/08/tutorials-index.html) and even some [giveaways](http://corgipants.blogspot.com/2008/10/bloggy-giveaway-carnival.html). Fun!
