If you like making Artist Trading Cards (ATCs) and need a new challenge, join the [Famous people in fruit or veggie disguise ATC swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/96499). The **international** swap is hosted by [Bluebird1981](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Bluebird1981) and is open to new users and experienced swappers with a 4.85 rating, or higher. 

The swap instructions:

_&#8220;You choose a famous actor, actress, singer, group, athlete, &#8230;. and try to link their name to a piece of fruit or a vegetable. For example: [John Lemon](http://www.flickr.com/photos/60140190@N08/5974018956/in/photostream/) (= John Lennon) seen here in the ATC by Bluebird1981. </p> 

The more creative you are, the better. Try to choose a real famous person, one that&#8217;s known around the globe, as this is an international swap! Draw or paint your idea on a standard ATC size card with a steady background. (2.5 x 3.5 inches). The head of the figure is a fruit or a vegetable. It has a small body. Be sure to take some time to create this ATC. You can use embellishments or stickers, but the figure has to be hand drawn or painted.&#8221;</i>

Such a funny idea! If you want to join to fun, sign up for the swap before this Friday, August 12th.
