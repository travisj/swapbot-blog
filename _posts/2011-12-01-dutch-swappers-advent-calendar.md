If you celebrate Christmas, you will love this fun project organized by the [Dutch Swappers Group](http://www.swap-bot.com/group/45323d4339863b506b93b3301d405166/about)&#8230;

The Dutch Swappers put together a <a href="http://dutchswappers.

blogspot.com/2011/11/nieuws-dutch-swappers-adventkalender.html&#8221;>**24 day blog hop advent calendar**</a>. You can see the advent calendar below and even share it on your own site if you&#8217;d like. 

Each day around noon, a new box filled with a creative tutorial, a giveaway, or a free printable will be revealed. Each member of the group is providing one of the days&#8217; posts and each day is a new craft surprise! 

(Most of the blog posts are in Dutch, but if you use Google Chrome, you can translate the pages easily. _Thanks to [kimminita](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kimminita) for letting me know about this fun project._)
