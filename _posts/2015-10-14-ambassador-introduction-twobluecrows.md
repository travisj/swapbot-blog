And I regret that I still have not introduced all of the awesome participants yet&#8230; but I will rectify that over the next few weeks with ONE more intro blog post. The Ambassadors are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities. If you are interested in representing Swap-bot in your area and sending out Swap-bot swag, stay tuned for info about our upcoming second round of Ambassador applications._

She is a chef who loves Doctor Who, Johannes Vermeer, collage, miniatures, tea, and of course, crows!

**Ambassador Region:** Connecticut, USA

**How twobluecrows found Swap-bot:** &#8220;Back in 2006 I was swapping in a lot of crafty Yahoo Groups, and someone brought it up and it sounded interesting!&#8221; 

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;It&#8217;s allowed me an outlet for trying a lot of new crafts, learning new skills in making good swaps, and introduced me to a lot of new friends.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;In the past eight years, my favorite swap has always been the most recent. Though, I look back on them sometimes and would like to start all over again!&#8221;

_I hope you are enjoying getting to know your fellow swappers with these Ambassador Introductions. We are so lucky to have so many awesome crafters, artists, writers, and snail mail lovers participating on Swap-bot! [Twobluecrows](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:twobluecrows) is taking a break from active swapping right now, but if you have any old CDs, she is collecting them for an art project._
