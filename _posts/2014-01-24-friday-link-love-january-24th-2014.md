Wow. 2014 is chugging along! **Only 20 days until Valentine&#8217;s Day!** I love the February holiday, but I feel unprepared this year&#8230; maybe these links will help! Enjoy&#8230;

  * You know I love this [S&#8217;more Valentine gift idea](http://anightowlblog.com/2013/02/smores-mason-jar-valentines.html). Inside the jar is a S&#8217;more snack mix of graham crackers, mini marshmallows, and chocolate.
  * Not a Valentine exactly, but I love these [DIY wool ball coasters](http://www.inspiredbycharm.com/2014/01/diy-wool-felt-ball-coasters.html) too much to not share.
