Swap-bot user [DreamBubble](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:DreamBubble) is a film student who loves pen palling. She is currently working on a documentary film project about pen palling, and she needs your help! 

If you&#8217;d like to be a part of the project, answer one or all of these questions:


** 

  * Tell me a good story about your experience with pen-palling.
  * Tell me a bad story about your experience with pen-palling.
  * Make a list of questions you&#8217;d like to see answered in the documentary, as straight-forward, zany, and/or interesting as you please.
</b> </ul> 

You can put your answers to the questions in the comment section here, or contact [DreamBubble](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:DreamBubble) directly via the messaging system. She is also looking for used postage stamps to use in the film.
