Well, hello there! Happy Friday! Are you ready for your weekly dose of links?! Father&#8217;s Day is in a little more than a week, so I collected a few crafty gift ideas for you. (Above is a photo of me and my sweet dad approximately 30 years ago.) 

**For Father&#8217;s Day:**

  * [101 handmade gift ideas for men!](http://www.everythingetsy.com/2012/05/101-handmade-gifts-for-men-diy/)
  * I feel bad that dads always seem to get stuck with neck ties for Father&#8217;s Day, but these [double-decker necktie cookies](http://www.munchkinmunchies.com/2012/06/doubledecker-necktie-cookies.html) are pretty cute. Or, you could make these [hot dog cookies](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/05/hot-dog-cookies-cakespy-recipe.html)!
  * For a necktie-free gift ideas, check out [Etsy&#8217;s Father&#8217;s Day round up](http://www.etsy.com/blog/en/2012/fathers-day-beyond-the-tie/).
  * [Craftzine also has some great gift ideas for dad.](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2012/06/fathers_day_gift_guide_2012.html)
  * Use these [free printables from Embellish](http://embellishgoods.blogspot.com/2012/06/free-printables-happy-fathers-day-to.html#) to create an awesome party for your pop!

**Other fun stuff:**

  * DIY tutorial: [Chunky Link Ball Chain Friendship Bracelets](http://stripesandsequins.com/2012/06/diy-chunky-link-ball-chain-friendship-bracelets.html) from Stripes + Sequins. Very cool!
  * Love this [DIY gold ring necklace from Flax + Twine](http://www.flaxandtwine.com/2012/06/diy-gold-ring-necklace-year-of-handmade.html), too.
  * Yum! So colorful! [Jello cookies.](http://www.iheartnaptime.net/jello-cookies/)
  * [Make an iPad case out of duct tape!](http://indiecrafts.craftgossip.com/2012/06/07/duck-tape-ipad-cover/)
  * The creators of BurdaStyle just launched a new DIY community site: [Kollabora](http://www.acedepartment.com/blog/2012/06/08/kollabora/). It is still in beta, but it looks like it will be a great resource for craft tutorials and supplies.
  * S&#8217;more of the week: I gotta get some of these [S&#8217;muffins](http://gottahavesmore.com/smuffins)!
  * I could display those S&#8217;muffins on this awesome, DIY, [cardboard cupcake stand from Oh Happy Day](http://ohhappyday.com/2012/06/diy-cupcake-stand-with-free-template/).
  * Just for fun: [True Story &#8211; I&#8217;m a Trekkie.](http://www.yesandyes.org/2012/05/true-story-im-trekkie.html)

Have a fun weekend!
