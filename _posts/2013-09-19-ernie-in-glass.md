This amazing Ernie the Envie constructed in glass was made by [smadronia](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:smadronia). She made one for her partner, [FunnerKimberley](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:FunnerKimberley), for the [Ernie the Envie Inspired Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/154162) last month AND she also made one for ME! I am so excited. I will cherish Glass Ernie and he will be displayed in a prominent place in Swap-bot HQ.

Smadronia sent a letter explaining the complex glass fusing process:

_&#8220;I used one of your Ernie postcards for reference, and cut the glass to shape, as well as all the little pieces. The mouth gave me a little trouble, as glass doesn't like to cut into circles well. I ended up using a couple pieces of scrap glass that already had curves cut into them.</p> 

Once everything was cut, I cleaned all the pieces and arranged the in the film. Once the pieces were in the kiln, and laid out correctly, they spent 12 hours in there. Ordinarily, glass goes to almost 1500 degrees, but for this style of fusing, I only took it to 1350. That way the piece didn't come out completely smooth.&#8221;</i>

Fascinating! What an incredible craft process! Ernie definitely looks striking in glass!
