</div>age-8888&#8243; /></a>Happy Friday, everyone! I didn&#8217;t find a ton of links this week, so feel free to add more in the comments. We need more spring craft tutorials!  * Wow! [What beautiful Easter ideas!](http://decor8blog.com/2012/03/30/color-me-pretty-easter-ideas/) (Look at those painted eggs above created by [Leslie Shewring](http://acreativemint.typepad.com/) for [Decor8](http://decor8blog.com/).)  * Speaking of spring, this cute [Carrot Patch Pudding](http://thesevenyearcottage.com/2012/the-carrot-patch/) would make a fun themed dessert.  * Need more dessert recipes? How about these [Rolo Fudge Brownies](http://cookiesandcups.com/rolo-fudge-brownies/), or this [Best Chocolate Cake recipe](http://www.bakersroyale.com/cakes/ruffled-cake/)?  * You can tell I have chocolate on the brain. I think I am going to try making these [Chocolate Chip Pudding Cookies](http://www.mommysavers.com/2012/03/chocolate-chip-pudding-cookies/) this weekend.  * Looking for an alternative to Etsy? I just discovered [Luulla](http://www.luulla.com/home), a marketplace and community for handmade.  * Because we all love snail mail, this index of over [100 envelope templates and tutorials on Mel Stampz](http://melstampz.blogspot.com/2008/07/5-12-inch-square-envelope-template-lots.html) is very helpful!**What are you doing this weekend?**
