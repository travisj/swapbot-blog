I was so excited to discover that Swap-bot&#8217;s cards (and my glittery matchbox) were included in an [article on the Overnight Prints blog about the &#8220;Best Business Cards.&#8221;](http://overnightprints.com/blog/best_business_cards/) I love designing Swap-bot merchandise and business collateral, and this just gets me more motivated to create some new items! Thanks, [Overnight Prints](http://www.overnightprints.com/)!
