&#8220;There&#8217;s so many gorgeous colours and wonderful smells during this season. One incredible smell is a tasty dessert from our fall produce. Some of you have favourite cheesecake recipes (like pumpkin) or cake recipes (like carrot or zuchinni) or a favourite pie.&#8221;

That is a quote from the description of this week&#8217;s featured swap, [Autumn Decadence and a Surprise](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/99271). The **international** swap is being hosted by [pinkrenegade](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pinkrenegade). For this postal mail swap, you will have one partner and you will share with them one tried and true favourite dessert recipe you use at this time of year. ALSO send a small fall surprise that can be profile base but it really is sender&#8217;s choice.

An easy and flexible swap to help us celebrate the change of seasons!
