The news just broke today that [Craft: magazine will no longer be printed](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2009/02/craft_volume_10_is_our_last_is.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954). [Issue 10](http://craftzine.com/10/) is their last printed issue, and they will focus entirely on the [Craftzine.com](http://www.craftzine.com/) website going forward. I am a little sad because I have subscribed to Craft: magazine since its beginning and I always secretly wished I had been the person who created it. However, I think moving exclusively to the web is very smart and perfectly in line with the indie craft community. 

In the past the Craft: blog mostly re-posted tons and tons of craft stories from around the web (including a little Swap-bot press [here](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2006/11/holiday_swaps.html) and [here](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2007/01/magic_yarn_ball_swap_on_swapbo.html)). It was difficult to keep up with it all and it reinforced the craft-o-sphere internet echo chamber. With the print magazine&#8217;s closure, Craft has the opportunity to improve their web presence, and they plan to do just that. Senior editor, Natalie Zee Drieu, and her team plan to publish more, higher quality, original tutorials and articles on the website &#8211; bringing the magazine content and style to the internet. I am excited to see how the Craftzine.com evolves! I think it will become an even greater resource for indie crafters.
