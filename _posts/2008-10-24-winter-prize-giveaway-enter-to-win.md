Announcing our first Swap-bot giveaway! We wanted to come up with a way to reward our awesome Swap-bot users and make the place a little more fun in the process. We decided to start by doing monthly giveaways of fun prizes. The first giveaway prize features a collection [Making Memories](http://www.makingmemories.com/) holiday crafting supplies. Making Memories is basically a scrapbooking brand, but I love to use their embellishments for all sorts of crafts, like matchboxes, greeting cards, collages, etc. One winner of this giveaway will receive the following (brand-spanking-new) goodies:
