This is the first edition of a new Swap-bot blog series: **Member Spotlights** . Our plan is to interview and highlight a new Swap-bot member every other week. This week, we would like to introduce you to [**sewcrazy**](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sewcrazy). Sewcrazy&#8217;s real name is Betty and she is one of the most prolific swappers on the &#8216;bot. At this time, she is the member with the most hearts: 842!! She has sent nearly 600 swaps and has received over 1000 ratings! Wow! Betty loves swapping ATCs, and you can see her holding one of her many ATC binders in the photo above. (As for the car behind Betty, her husband of 43 years, Bill, is a huge fan of NASCAR.)

I asked Betty a few questions about herself and her love of swapping&#8230;

**How did you first get involved with Swap-bot?**
  
I was trading ATCs on another site and Jennifer, the coordinator of &#8216;Somethings Fishy,&#8217; told me about this site.

**What is your favorite item to swap?**
  
I have enjoyed swapping ATCs the most for two reasons: one, because I just love creating these little treasures of art, and two, because if and when I get flaked on (and yes, there has been a few) I am not really loosing much. Not that I consider my ATCs &#8216;not much&#8217;. I just feel there has to be a reason why my partners&#8217; ATCs didn&#8217;t get to their destination. It hasn&#8217;t stopped me from continuing to swap.

**Do you usually do international or more local swaps?**
  
I do international on the ATCs only, because postage-wise it isn&#8217;t too expensive.

**Describe the best (or one of the best) swap packages you have ever received?**
  
I have received so many good swaps that I couldn&#8217;t really name one. But, I think my favorite was the comment and heart that I received from a partner to whom I sent, and she sent me a thank you surprise. She was ecstatic about a set of ATCs. It made me feel very good.

**What do you like most about swapping?**
  
The friendship and the chance to show off what I do, good or bad, people are very receptive of everything.

**How much time per week do you spend working on swaps?**
  
I couldn&#8217;t really say how much time I spend per week. Sometimes I can sit down and whip out a bunch of ATCs and other times I struggle to come up with the theme. I usually have them done ahead of time and waiting for my partners&#8217; names. I sign up for a swap only if I can envision the ATC and have the materials to create it, without having to run to town to get something to complete it.

**Is there a type of swap have you always wanted to try, but haven&#8217;t yet?** 
  
I have probably tried most swaps. Some only once, others more to try and get a feel for them. But, I always end up sticking to ATCs, I like them the most.

**What are your other hobbies, besides swapping?**
  
I am a seamstress, love to make quilts and incorporate that talent into some of my ATCs. I teach a quilt class in Othello, Washington, where I used to live. I also have just recently taken up greeting card making. And, there again, I use some of the ideas from the cards that I make, scaled down to ATC size. I love to check out yard sales and flea markets to find treasures for my ATCs.

**What does your family and friends think of your swapping habit?** 
  
My family enjoys seeing what I have done, I think!!! I got my daughter hooked on making ATCs. We have a lot of fun trading through swaps and sharing ideas.

**Do you have any advice for first-time swappers or new Swap-bot members?**
  
Enjoy what you do, don&#8217;t stress yourself out on a swap. Your work is your work, period. Don&#8217;t let anyone else&#8217;s work intimidate you. But, mostly, just enjoy what you create.

**Who would you like to see interviewed next for a member spotlight?**
  
That would be Swap-bot member, dolly, and of course, my daughter, VWwoman07. She is very creative and is a lot like me. I have traded with dolly a lot and she comes up with some pretty unique ATCs, I always love to receive cards from her.
