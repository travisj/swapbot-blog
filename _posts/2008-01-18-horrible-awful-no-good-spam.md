Like many Swap-bot users, I received an outrageous &#8220;investment opportunity&#8221; message in my Swap-bot inbox on Thursday morning from user, sand208karaka. If you received a message from sand208karaka please know that it is a scam and delete the message. This bogus user was able to spam hundreds of Swap-bot members in a very short time. However, the account was quickly shut down and the user can no longer log into Swap-bot or participate in any way on our site.

We do not allow spam of any type on Swap-bot. I you receive any other messages that you believe are spam, please forward them to me at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. We may implement additional security features in the future which will further prevent spam from being sent to our users. I will keep you posted.
