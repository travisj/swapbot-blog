What is inspiring you this week? This collection of links are the things that really caught my eye and inspired me to be creative this week&#8230; Enjoy!

  * Isn&#8217;t the scene above cool? Those are [99 yarn-bombed trees in Austin, Texas](http://www.re-nest.com/re-nest/crafts-and-sewing/99-yarn-bombed-trees-by-knittaplease-142211). The trees were covered in knitted yarn tree cozies made by Magda Sayeg, also known as [KnittaPlease](http://knittaporfavor.wordpress.com/), and 170 volunteers. The installation is called &#8220;Knitted Wonderland.&#8221; (See also: [Yarn bombed pot holes in Paris](http://www.re-nest.com/re-nest/crafts-and-sewing/yarn-bombed-potholes-by-juliana-santacruz-herrera-141524).)
  * Every Saturday is &#8220;Swap-bot Saturday&#8221; over on the blog, [_Prompt Me to Greatness_](http://promptedprojects.blogspot.com/). Last Saturday, the author shared an awesome [Doctor Who matchbox shrine](http://promptedprojects.blogspot.com/2011/03/doctor-who-matchbox-shrine-swap-bot.html) that she made for a swap. Very cool.
  * These Easter eggs are mind-boggling: [actual cross-stitching on eggs](http://www.sublimestitching.com/forostyukinna)!
  * I know there are some Hello Kitty fans out there&#8230; you&#8217;ll love this extravagant [Hello Kitty-themed birthday party](http://prunillefee.canalblog.com/archives/2011/03/24/20703619.html) on the French and English blog, _Prunille fait son show_. And for slightly different tastes, check out this [Beatles-themed party](http://www.hostessblog.com/2011/03/babymania-beatles-inspired-birthday-pt-2/) on _Hostess with the Mostess_ and this [Astronaut party](http://lifefrosting.blogspot.com/2010/02/astronaut-training-party.html) on _Life Frosting_. 
  * [Mini cupcake toppers for cupcakes?!](http://thatsnoice.com.au/cupcake-cupcake-topper/) Will this cause a rift in the space-time continuum? 
  * [Learn how to print your own fabric on PoppyTalk.](http://poppytalk.blogspot.com/2011/03/diy-print-your-own-fabric.html)
  * [And, learn how to make a funky bead and wire necklace on _lightbluegrey_.](http://lightbluegrey.blogspot.com/2011/03/good-looking.html)
  * With my renewed [interest in quilting](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/03/10/the-national-quilt-museum/), I really want to attend Monday&#8217;s [Mini Quilt Craft Night at Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/storque/events/come-stitch-mini-quilts-at-etsy-labs-12515/). Will you be there?
  * If you like online shopping, or just browsing pretty things, check out [_A Very Fine Thing_](http://averyfinething.com/). The site showcases a few lovely, hand-picked items each day.
