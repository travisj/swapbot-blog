In order to improve the safety, fairness, and overall efficiency of Swap-bot, we have implemented a few major policy changes. 

**Usernames** <em style="display:none"><a href="http://blog.segd.org/?hellboy_animated_sword_of_storms">Hellboy Animated: Sword of Storms divx</a></em> 

The first thing that you will notice is that we are switching to unique, static usernames to replace the old display names. When you next log into Swap-bot you will be asked to choose a username. Please choose carefully as usernames are unchangeable and will stay with your account forever. After picking your username it will replace your old display name throughout the entire Swap-bot site and you will be able to use it to log into Swap-bot from then on. Usernames may only consist of letters and numbers. Other characters, offensive words, and any HTML or Markdown code are not allowed in usernames. Each person&#8217;s username must be unique. We suggest picking a username that is close to your old display name so that other members will be able to easily recognize you. 

We know that this change will cause some confusion at first. We are sorry for any inconvenience, but this change is necessary as Swap-bot continues to grow. You might want to list your old display name in your profile somewhere if your username is significantly different. We expect all of our users to pick their new usernames fairly and to not misrepresent their identity in any manner. If you have any problems with the new username feature, please contact us at questions[at]swap-bot.com.

**Unique Addresses**

From this point on, each individual is only allowed **one** Swap-bot account. Every new account must have a unique address, as well as a unique username and email address. We have implemented new computerized strategies for assuring the uniqueness of each new user&#8217;s identity. We no longer allow (nor did we ever encourage) members to create multiple accounts. 

Another major change is that you are no longer able to delete your account. If you wish to leave Swap-bot you can remove all of your address info and terminate Swap-bot communications, but your username and rating history will always be visible. **This means that your current Swap-bot account is your only Swap-bot account!** You will not be able to scrap it and start a new one if you get bad ratings. 

These changes are unfortunately not retroactive. If you currently have multiple accounts you will not be punished. However, if you are observed behaving dishonestly or abusing the system, one, or all, of your accounts may be partially or fully suspended. 

If you are a new user who would like to participate in Swap-bot but you have the same address as a current member, you must contact Swap-bot Admins to discuss exceptions to the unique address policy. You can email us at questions[at]swap-bot.com. Family members and roommates currently using Swap-bot with the same address should not be affected by the new policy. However, if you encounter any problems while trying to edit your address please contact us. 

**Editing Your Profile**

You will notice that the links to edit your profile and manage your account have disappeared. You can now edit all of the information related to your account and your visible profile by clicking on the word **(edit)** next to the **Profile** link at the top of most Swap-bot pages. The profile editing system has now been divided into a few different categories to make editing a bit simpler. Let us know if you have any questions or encounter any problems. 

We know these changes will make Swap-bot more efficient and fair. Thank you for your patience and understanding while they are being implemented.
