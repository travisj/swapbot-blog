If you log into Swap-bot you won&#8217;t really notice anything different (I hope), but I reworked some of the CSS that is responsible for the positioning of the site. Please check it out and if you notice anything not quite working right, please let me know. I tried to make the site more accessible for swappers with an 800&#215;600 screen resolution (about 12% of pageviews).

For anyone interested in CSS, I followed the [3 column example at Mollio](http://www.mollio.org/).
