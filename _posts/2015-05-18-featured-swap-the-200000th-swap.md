**[Come one, come all to Swap-bot&#8217;s 200,000th swap!!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/200000)** 

Wow. Can you believe so many swaps have been hosted on the &#8216;bot?! Swap-bot has been running for nearly 10 years, but the number still blows me away. (It feels like just yesterday that I hosted the [100,000th swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/100000).)

In honor of our very first swap, the [200,000th Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/200000) is an easy, international, Type 2 postcard swap. Nearly everyone &#8212; new and experienced users alike &#8212; are welcome to join this fun and inclusive snail mail exchange. That being said, there is a 4.8 rating requirement and I will remove questionable participants with any recent 1s or problematic behavior.

For the swap, you simply **send one postcard to each of your two partners**. The postcards are sender&#8217;s choice, and can be store bought or handmade. They can be in a Swap-bot theme (and I would LOVE to see photos of you creations!) but they do not have to be. However, **you MUST include a note on your cards describing one of your favorite swap experiences**.

[Sign up](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/200000) by May 29th, and send by June 19th. Easy peasy.

If you are reading this, **THANK YOU for making Swap-bot what it is!** We are so thankful to all of our members for hosting so many awesome swaps and making it such a fun and creative community. Here&#8217;s to a million more swaps!!! (Hey, it could happen!)
