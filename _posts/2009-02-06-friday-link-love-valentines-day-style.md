Valentine&#8217;s day is fast approaching, but there is still time to make or buy a special gift or plan a fun, lovey-dovey activity. Hopefully, the following links will help:

  * Purple, Pink, and Orange has a lovely [Valentine&#8217;s Day Gift Guide](http://www.purplepinkandorange.com/giftguide/) with lots of sponsored discounts and coupons from the retailers.
  * The [Etsy Storque](http://www.etsy.com/storque/) has spotlighted a few different Valentine&#8217;s-themed selections over the last few days. Check out the [Sweeten Up Your Romance](http://www.etsy.com/storque/spotlight/etsy-finds-sweeten-up-your-romance-3345/) and [Dedicated to the One I Love](http://www.etsy.com/storque/spotlight/etsy-finds-dedicated-to-the-one-i-love-3346/) selections.
  * Download the free kitting pattern for the [Smitten from Cocoknits](http://cocoknits.com/knit/garments/accessories/smitten.html). It is a two-handed mitten that you can share with your sweetie. A little wacky &#8211; a lot sweet.
