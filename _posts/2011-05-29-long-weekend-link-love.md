It is Sunday, a little late for the usual &#8220;Friday Link Love,&#8221; but I couldn&#8217;t skip sharing all these great links with you this week&#8230;.

  * Decor8 has a detailed [tutorial for making the pretty flower napkin ring](http://decor8blog.com/2011/05/16/diy-liberty-flower-napkin-rings) seen above. Also, check out the site&#8217;s lovely [spring garland tutorial](http://decor8blog.com/2011/05/16/diy-spring-garlands-using-liberty-fabrics).
  * I want to make these [refrigerator dill pickles](http://oneperfectbite.blogspot.com/2010/08/refrigerator-dill-pickles.html) from One Perfect Bite. Such a good summer snack!
  * Check out the city of Philadelphia&#8217;s [public Mural Arts Program](http://explorer.muralarts.org/#/mural/love_letter). I wish every city had public art projects like it.
  * Have you heard of [Craftgawker](http://craftgawker.com/)? It&#8217;s a photo gallery site that allows you to visually search and discover handmade arts and crafts to inspire your own projects. They publish lots of new images every weekday from the top art and craft blogs. Very addicting!
  * A cool [Fabric Necklace Tutorial](http://abeautifulmess.typepad.com/my_weblog/2011/05/fabric-necklace-tutorial-from-jenni.html) on A Beautiful Mess.
  * [50 Summer Crafts for Kids](http://thelongthread.com/?p=7880) on The Long Thread.
  * This is just cute: [Geronimo Balloon Company](http://geronimoballoons.com/).
  * Have you seen this new &#8220;lady website&#8221; co-created by actress and musician, [Zooey Deschanel](http://twitter.com/#!/therealzooeyd), called [Hello Giggles](http://hellogiggles.com/). Admittedly, the name is a little corny, and I&#8217;m not sure what to think about their [12-year-old contributing author](http://hellogiggles.com/mikaela-foster), but I&#8217;ll stay tuned. 
  * Want to learn a little more about Swap-bot? [Simone Collins](http://www.spazzgirl.com/) interviewed me about Swap-bot for a [post Friday on Craft Critique](http://www.craftcritique.com/2011/05/crafter-interview-rachel-johnson-from.html) as part of their Crafty Business Week.
  * One more little self-promotion-type item: I am doing a [&#8220;Diary Challenge&#8221;](http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=4019) until the end of June. I was inspired by this [post about the benefits of keeping a work diary](http://www.acedepartment.com/blog/2011/05/26/work-diary/). Do you have a blog, journal, or diary? Join me in the Challenge and write in it everyday for the next month! Leave a link to your site in the comments, so that I can follow along with your daily writings. 

Are you doing anything fun for the long weekend? Any big craft projects? I am going to play with my new [Teresa Collins Stampmaker](http://www.teresacollinsstampmaker.com)!
