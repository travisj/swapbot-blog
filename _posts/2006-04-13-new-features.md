I added a bunch of new features to Swap-bot tonight. First, since we were getting so many swaps, I decided swap categories were needed. You can now assign your swap up to three categories and users can search for swaps by category on the View Swaps page. 

I also tried to increase usability by clearing up actions that users could preform when they belonged to a swap. To check this feature out, log into Swap-bot and view the details of a swap that you are a member of. (My favorite feature is the photo upload &#8211; if it doesn&#8217;t work on Windows please let me know).

Finally, I added the ability to make comments about a swap. It is a very basic feature at this point, but as suggestions come in, I can make improvements.

If you find anything wrong with any of these new features, please let me know and I will get them fixed ASAP.
