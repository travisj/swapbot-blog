October and the Halloween holiday will be here before we know it. To get us in the spooky Halloween spirit, this week we are featuring the [Halloween Goodie Bag Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/41777), hosted by [AmyCrockett](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:AmyCrockett). The swap is quick and simple with only one partner, but it sounds like a lot of fun: &#8220;Decorate 1 goody bag (lunch sack size) using stickers, embellishments, ribbon, buttons and/or paper around the Halloween theme. Inside you can place just about anything..candy, pencils, notepads, candles, lotions, Halloween mix cd, stickers, whatever as long as it is Halloween-ish! Check your partners profile for ideas. Do not spend more than $10 on this swap.&#8221; The swap is international and open to any and all swappers. Get signed up before the end of September to join in on the Halloween fun!
