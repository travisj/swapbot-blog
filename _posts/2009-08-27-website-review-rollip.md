It is called and it allows you &#8220;give any digital photo the classic look and feel of a vintage or Polaroid picture.&#8221; It is a super-simple site to use (you do not have to create an account, which is a huge relief &#8211; no need to enter all of your contact info again, like on most other sites) and it offers a bunch of funky effects that you can use on your own photos. I created the two images below using two different Polaroid styles on the site.

is a really quick and easy way to jazz up your so-so digital images or give any photo a vintage feel &#8211; give it a try!
