We have been working on a few small site changes this weekend. Here are the details:

  * Swap partners are no longer auto assigned. This has been a confusing subject mostly due to my own mistakes and bad info, however we have now come to a solution which we believe will be most effective. Coordinators are now completely responsible for assigning partners for their swaps. The Swap-bot computer will NOT auto-assign partners at any time. Coordinators have one week (7 days) to assign partners for their swaps. If partners are not assigned within one week the swap is DELETED by the Swap-bot computer. All participants will receive an email letting them know that the swap was deleted. 
    <em style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?air_force_one">Air Force One on dvd</a></em> Side note: If a swap has been deleted because the coordinator has not logged in for over a week and never assigned partners, we consider it perfectly acceptable for one of the swap&#8217;s participants to start a similar swap.

  * You can now drop from swaps at any time before partners are assigned. Before you could not drop from a swap if the sign up deadline had passed, now you can drop after the sign up deadline if partners are not assigned.
  * I have revised the FAQ to reflect these changes, but as always let me know if you notice any errors. 
  * One more little change for group founders: We have added the date that users requested to join a group under their info on the group &#8220;Approve Join Requests&#8221; pages.

We hope you like these changes. Happy swapping!

UPDATE: My wording above may be slightly confusing. Coordinators do not actually have to pair up the participants in their swaps, they simply have to initiate the process by clicking the &#8220;assign partners&#8221; link. The Swap-bot computer still matches all partners. It just does not ever initiate that process automatically. Sorry for any confusion.<strong style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?hondo">Hondo dvdrip</a></strong>
