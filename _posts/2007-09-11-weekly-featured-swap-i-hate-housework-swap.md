</p>

for this week's featured swap, because, hey, I hate housework too! The swap was created by [Liz Z.](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=7386) and it is open for sign up through September 28th. The swap is simple: just send your one partner items to make housework more fun. Things like music, nice cleaning supplies, a list of house cleaning tips and tricks, or a reward for when the cleaning is done are all items you could include. Spend at least $5 and put everything

in a box to send to your partner. Before you know it your house will be all sparkly and clean!

(The swap is open to participants in the United States with a 4.75 rating, or higher, who have participated in a box swap before. Like always, read the full [swap description](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/7020)
