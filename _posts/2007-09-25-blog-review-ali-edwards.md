[Ali Edwards](http://aliedwards.typepad.com/_a_/) is a designer and self-proclaimed &#8220;life artist&#8221; who teaches scrapbooking classes all over the country and the world. Her artwork and designs are amazing (just check out her [mini books](http://aliedwards.typepad.com/photos/thanksgiving_album/index.html) or <a href=http://aliedwards.typepad.com/photos/recent_work/index.html">scrapbook layouts</a>) and her blog is very inspiring. She writes nearly everyday about everything from her design work and home life to autism awareness. In the past she has raised thousand of dollars through her blog for autism research. [Ali&#8217;s site](http://aliedwards.typepad.com/_a_/) will inspire your creativity and your spirit.
