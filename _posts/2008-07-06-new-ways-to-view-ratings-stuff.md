In addition to trying to correct some of the glitches caused by moving to the new server, we also created some new ways to view ratings and made some Swap-bot graphics available today.

**Ratings**

There is now more info in the upper right Ratings section of the profile pages. You will notice that you can now quickly see how many ones, threes, and fives each user has received by looking at the rating box on their profile page. The number of ratings listed at the bottom of the profiles has been limited to the most recent twenty, but all ratings are viewable on each member's rating page. 

<a href='http://www.rljart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ratingbox.gif'><img src="http://www.rljart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ratingbox.gif" alt="" title="ratingbox" width="314" height="198" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1456" /></a>

On all profile pages you can now click on the numbers under any of the profile rating box categories to see all of those types of ratings displayed in the center column of the page. (For example, you can click on the number of hearts to see all of the ratings given to the swapper that contained hearts.) You can then click on the swapper's name to be taken back to their profile or continue browsing their ratings using the rating filter options in the upper right corner. Play around and try out different viewing options!

You can now view the swaps for which you (or others) have received coordinator stars! When you click on the number of stars on any profile, you are shown a linked list of the star swaps. We promised that feature a long time ago, and now it is finally possible!

**STUFF** 

We finally have a [&#8220;Stuff&#8221; page](http://www.swap-bot.com/stuff.php) ! There you will find links to all of Swap-bot's web presences (like MySpace and Facebook) as well as tons of cute graphics that you can use on your own blog or website. Feel free to take any of the graphics or link directly to them, but make sure to link to Swap-bot.com.
