This week&#8217;s featured swap was inspired by the adorable fabric gift pouch seen above. A tutorial for the fabric pouch is featured on [A Spoonful of Sugar](http://www.aspoonfulofsugardesigns.com/2011/02/fabric-gift-pouch.html), and swap coordinator [Csquaredreations](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Csquaredcreations) thought they would be a fun item to swap. If you agree, join the [Super Cute Gift Pouch Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/93404).

For the **international** swap, you make one of the fabric gift pouches for your partner. You do not have to fill the pouch with goodies, but that would be a fun way to spoil your partner! Sign up for the swap by Friday, June 24th. New users with a filled out profile and experienced swappers with a 5.0 rating are welcome to join. Remember to read the [full swap description](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/93404) before signing up! Happy sewing and swapping!
