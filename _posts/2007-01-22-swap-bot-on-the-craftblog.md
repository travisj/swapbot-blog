[<img id="image35" class="alignleft" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/craft.png" alt="craft.png" />](http://craftzine.com/blog/)The Magic Yarn Ball swap and Swap-bot were featured on the [Craft: blog](http://www.craftzine.com/blog/archive/2007/01/magic_yarn_ball_swap_on_swapbo.html) today. So cool! We love [Craft: magazine](http://www.craftzine.com/) and Natalie Zee Drieu, the associate editor. For all of you crafty swappers out there, Craft: is hosting a handmade, recycled [Valentine&#8217;s Day card contest](http://www.craftzine.com/blog/archive/2007/01/craft_valentines_day_card_cont.html). Sounds fun&#8230; and there are prizes!
