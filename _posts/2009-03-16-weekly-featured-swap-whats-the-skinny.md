  [[Get Your Ex Boyfriend Back](http://howtogettheexback.webs.com/ "Get Your Ex Boyfriend Back") <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/swap-5.jpg" alt="" title="swap-5" width="200" height="341" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-628" />](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/32189) This week&#8217;s featured swap is for a craft form that is entirely new to me: Skinny Cards. A &#8220;skinny&#8221; is like an Artist Trading Card except that it&#8217;s bigger &#8211; it measures 3&#8243; by 5&#8243;. The cards can be decorated using various techniques and media &#8211; just like ATCs. (I have added skinny to the new [Swap & Craft Term Glossary](http://blog.swap-bot.com/swap-craft-term-glossary/)!) [What&#8217;s the SKINNY?!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/32189) is the first swap (that I know of) for skinny cards on Swap-bot. The swap, hosted by [graydragon](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:graydragon) is international and it is open for sign up through the last day of March. Each participant has only one partner for whom they make one skinny card of any theme or style. You must have a 4.7 rating and a full profile to participate. 

Skinny cards seem like great collectible crafts for artists who need a little more room than an ATC provides. For more information and inspiration check out the [Skinny Cards Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/groups/skinnycards/) group.
