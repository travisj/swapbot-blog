Who doesn&#8217;t love unicorns, am I right?! The cutie you see above is original art by [Pagey on Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/people/Pagey?ref=ls_profile). 

Usually I prefer to feature handmade swaps here on the blog, but I couldn&#8217;t resist the allure of the unicorn this week! It you are also a fantasy animal fan, join the [Unicorn Postcard Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/94296) hosted by [MissiveMaven](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MissiveMaven). The swap is **international** and really easy. Just send one store-bought (or Etsy-bought) unicorn postcard to your one partner. All experienced swappers with a 4.9 rating or higher, and new users with excellent profiles are welcome to join. 

[Sign up](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/94296) asap! The swap closes on July 2nd!
