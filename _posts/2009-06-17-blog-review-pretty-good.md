_Living and Loving the pretty and the good._ 

[pretty good](http://www.itsprettygood.com/pretty_good/) is a a beautiful and unique photography blog maintained by Mary Swenson. Mary takes wonderful photographs and adds words to them in creative ways using Photoshop. The blog is an inspirational and very quick daily read that I highly recommend.
