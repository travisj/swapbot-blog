Having trouble figuring out how to mark a swap a sent, rate your partners, or view participants?

The yellow swap option box on all swap info pages is now located in the upper right corner of the page under the main blue links.

Some people (especially those using Internet Explorer) are still having layout issues and the right column flows below the middle column, making the yellow swap option box appear below the swap comments. That should not be happening and we will hopefully get it fixed asap. see image below for clarification.

The yellow option box is the same as it has always been, it is just in a slightly different spot. You should find all of your usual options in it.

The new layout changes should not be extremely drastic. If the site is looking terrible, try refreshing a few times. It might take a while to get the full new format loaded if you have the old version cached. We will also continue to work on the IE problems and adjust the text sizes and spacing throughout the site. Have patience. <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Thanks for your help. I promise things will keep on improving!
