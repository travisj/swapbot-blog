I visited the [Holiday Handmade Cavalcade](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/) on Sunday, here in New York City. It is an annual craft show put on by [The NewNew Etsy Street Team](http://thenewnew.blogspot.com/) and Swap-bot was one of the [sponsors](http://www.handmadecavalcade.com/sponsors.html). It was another well organized event with lots of shoppers. (I bought awesome greeting cards from [Virginia Kraljevic](http://www.etsy.com/shop/virginiakraljevic) and [My Zoetrope](http://www.myzoetrope.com/).)

Did anyone get there at the very start of the show and receive one of the goody bags? There was Swap-bot swag in them!!
