This week&#8217;s featured swap is a postcard swap with an intriguing twist. Coordinator, [carol](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:carol), has based her [Postcard Biography Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/42306) on the art/writing project of [Michael Kimball](http://www.michael-kimball.com/about.html). Kimball writes the entire life stories of individuals (strangers who contact him through his blog) on 4 x 6 postcards, in under 600 words. You can learn more about his project on his [blog](http://www.michael-kimball.com/blog.php) and by reading the [NPR story about him](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106749299).

For the [Postcard Biography Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/42306) you will write your own life story (in about 300 words) on postcards and send them to your three partners. From the swap description: _&#8220;Please don’t just write boring details (although you can include them too), but give us a glimpse into you. What makes you tick? What’s important in your world? Who or what shaped who you are? How?&#8221;_ 

The swap is international and open to new users, but you must sign up NOW &#8211; the sign up deadline is August 15th! I have signed up and I can&#8217;t wait to start working on my own mini life story!
