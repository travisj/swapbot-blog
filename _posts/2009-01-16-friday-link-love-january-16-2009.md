Hi, all. Your friends here at Swap-bot HQ have been traveling a lot lately, and man have we missed you! I am happy to be getting back into my internet routine of blogging and emails.

    posts a roundup of tutorials on their site every day called &#8220;Daily DIY.&#8221; It is kinda like one-stop shopping for all your craft project needs!</li> 
    
      * I like this [Coffee Cozy tutorial](http://houseonhillroad.typepad.com/coffeecozy.pdf) from Erin Harris of [House on Hill Road](http://houseonhillroad.typepad.com/). The big button makes it extra special.
      * These [mini, hanging lightbulb vases](http://craftershock.com/blog/2009/01/06/turn-your-old-light-bulbs-into-hanging-vases/) on [Craftershock](http://craftershock.com/blog/) are very delicate and lovely. They seem easy to make if you have the right tools&#8230;
      * Many of the [box, basket, and bucket tutorials](http://whipup.net/2008/11/18/colossal-list-of-tutorials-boxes-containers-baskets-buckets/) linked on Whip Up look like they may come in handy for all types of swaps.
      * I have been reading a lot about the book [The Gentle Art of Domesticity](http://www.amazon.com/Gentle-Art-Domesticity-Stitching-Comforts/dp/1584797363), by Jane Brocket. It showcases practical and imaginative projects of needlework, cooking, gardening, and homemaking. Apparently, the photography is very beautiful and inspiring.</ul>
