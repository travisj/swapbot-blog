I love contemporary art, so I'm excited for the [Contemporary Art Postcard Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/153757) hosted by [KSENiA](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KSENiA). 

Contemporary art can have a broad definition. It can include any art from the current time period or lifetime. Sometimes &#8220;contemporary&#8221; is defined as any art made after 1970, sometimes it designates art made post-2000, other times it refers to art made after the Postmodern period. 

Major contemporary museums include the [Whitney Museum](http://whitney.org), [MOMA PS1](http://momaps1.org), the [New Museum](http://www.newmuseum.org), and my personal fave, the [Kemper Museum](http://www.kemperart.org). 

For the [Contemporary Art Postcard Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/153757), you can send a postcard with an image of a Modern or Contemporary work of art. The art pictured on the postcard can be of any media: painting, drawing, graffiti, illustration, sculpture, collage, etc.

Some of my favorite contemporary artists include [Richard Diebenkorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Diebenkorn) (his painting _Ocean Park #125_ from the Whitney Museum is seen above), [Wayne Thiebaud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiebaud), [Kehinde Wiley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kehinde_Wiley), [Mickalene Thomas](http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/mickalene_thomas/), and [Gerhard Richter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Richter). But most likely, I will mail a postcard of one of my very favorite contemporary art series of all time, [The Quilts of Gee's Bend](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=970364). 

**What contemporary art postcard will you send?**
