_Yes, I am featuring my OWN swap once again&#8230; a little self-centered, but I hope I can be forgiven._

My goal for this [Easy Postcard Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/171370) is to get new users involved and more knowledgeable about the Swap-bot process. **This international postcard swap is open to all new and experienced Swap-bot members!** It is just about the easiest mail swap you can try. Simply send one naked (i.e. addressed, stamped, and NOT in an envelope) to one partner. You will then receive a postcard from another participant in the swap. Easy and fun! 

You can send any type of postcard that you&#8217;d like. The swap is **sender&#8217;s choice** (meaning you don&#8217;t have to cater to your partner&#8217;s profile) and store bought or handmade postcards are allowed. Write a nice note to your partner, address the postcard, put on some postage, and drop it in the mail! No sweat. 

[Sign up now!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/171370) Let&#8217;s make this a huge swap!

Just for fun: **What is your favorite type of postcard to receive?**

_p.s. I DO angel my swaps. Two weeks after the send deadline, if you have NOT received and you HAVE rated your partner honestly with a 1, you can contact me and I will send out an angel postcard._
