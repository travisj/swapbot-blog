The 2012 Swap-bot Holiday Donation Drive has officially ended and I have tallied up the results: [We raised more than $1700 for the Red Cross for Hurricane Sandy relief.](http://www.crowdrise.com/Swapbot4Sandy) Wow. We also collected a handful of gift cards and winter weather items for [The Partnership for the Homeless](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/). Great job, everyone! **Thank you for making this our most successful holiday donation drive yet!**
