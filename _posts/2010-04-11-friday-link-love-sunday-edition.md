I have a few more links to share with you from last week&#8230; better late than never!

  * Adorable, free, are available from Cathe Holden on her blog, Just Something I Made. I love the one (seen above) that holds a roll of stamps!
  * on Craftzine.com.
  * Anyone have an iPad already? This is one of the first craft projects I have seen for the the new gadgets: .
  * I feel bad telling you about this next one, because it will not help you with this month&#8217;s Stash Busting Challenge&#8230; but it seems too cool to keep to myself: . Everyday they offer up one craft item at a super sale price.
  * This one is just for laughs and because I LOVE Star Trek: 

And, here are few more links to help inspire your   **** endeavors:

  * on Crafts Unleashed.
  * made from paper scraps on Scoutie Girl.
  * on Dollar Store Crafts.
  * (and adults!) using everyday household items on Babble. 
  * If you need another reason to use up supplies from your craft stash, take the and make something ugly for a change! Ha!
