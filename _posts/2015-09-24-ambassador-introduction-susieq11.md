And I regret that I still have not introduced all of the awesome participants yet&#8230; but I will rectify that over the next few weeks with three more intro blog posts. The Ambassadors are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities. If you are interested in representing Swap-bot in your area and sending out Swap-bot swag, stay tuned for info about our upcoming second round of Ambassador applications._

**How susieq11 found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I was introduced to swap-bot by a friend in 2010. Once I saw it, I thought: WHERE WERE YOU ALL OF MY LIFE!? I have been a letter writer since I was about 8 or 9 &#8212; starting with letters from camp or to my relatives. Then I had pen-pals all over. I was always writing to &#8220;Big Blue Marble&#8221; as they paired you with pen pals! I am dating myself as a 70&#8217;s and early 80&#8217;s kid, ha ha! Several of my best friends were made via pen-palling. I even have a couple that I met from friendship books in the 80&#8217;s &#8212; and at 40+, we are still friends in real life! I have a pen pal in Finland that is one of my best friends. We started to write in high school and have met. I have met several swap-bot people too: [Rexypants](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:rexypants) and I have dubbed ourselves &#8220;twins&#8221; (shhh!). She lives in Vancouver and we have met a couple of times. Once in Seattle and then last year I flew out to visit her in BC! We iMessage waaaaayyy too much and keep USPS and Canada Post in business! [Maxbenleo](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:maxbenleo) and I are great friends and we have an annual tradition of meeting in Florida every summer now! She and her family visit each year from Germany and this July will be our second visit! I have met people locally, too. I write to a lot of people regularly, we connect on Facebook and whatsapp, etc. I swear we need a worldwide convention to meet up with swap-botters from everywhere!&#8221; 

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;See above!!!! OMG, it is so much fun!!!! I love the connections, even on an acquaintance level. So nice to have a community of fun people that you can share with. I love to set up swaps and it&#8217;s exciting to wait and see who your partners are! I love RAKs as I love to share my finds with people &#8212; and make their day by surprising them. This gives me a fun outlet for snail mail and new connections.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;Postcards, yes!! I am a crazy postcard lady&#8230;like cat ladies, but just postcards. My third bedroom is my postcard collection&#8217;s home! But so is part of my bedroom, ha ha! I also love note cards, used stamps, scavenger hunts, mail art, and anything paper related!&#8221;
