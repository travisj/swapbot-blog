The holiday season is upon us and it is a time for fun and for giving. Why not participate in a fun swap while also helping out others in need? Perhaps you already plan to donate to a special charity this season. Why not spread the word about why you find your cause so important? The [Season of Giving Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/25522) is open for sign up through December 10th, and you have a whole month to complete the swap. It is an international swap which welcomes new users. 

Here are the rules of the swap from the description:

  * You will make/buy something to donate to charity. This is any item you wish. This could be Warm gloves, Baby Blankets, Pet items for pet shelters, Toys for Tots items, anything you wish to make or buy to be donated.
  * You will then take a picture of the item you are donating. Print a picture of the item you are donating. You do not have to print high quality images or even on photo paper, printer paper will work fine, just make sure you can see the image clearly.
  * Donate the item.
  * Write a note to your partner about what you gave to charity & why you picked that particular charity.
  * Send the note along with the picture of what you donated to your partner!

Doing good feels good! Let&#8217;s spread the goodness around!
