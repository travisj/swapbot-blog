I have featured [matchbox swaps](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/11/30/weekly-swap-holiday-fun-matchbox-swap/) in the past, and also a [book thong swap](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/08/30/weekly-featured-swap-book-thong-swap/), but this is the first time that two have been combined in a featured swap&#8230; the [Book Thong in a Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/93140).

**The requirements:** &#8220;You will have one partner, to whom you will send one decorated matchbox, and in it, one book thong. The book thong has to be hand made! You can use a store bought matchbox, but you must decorate it yourself.&#8221;

The international swap is hosted by <A href=http://www.swap-bot.com/user:suki">suki</a> and it is open to new users and experienced swappers with a 4.8 rating or higher. [Sign up before July 10th!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/93140)
