**October 2015 will be Swap-bot&#8217;s 10-year anniversary.** Woah. I am truly astounded. My husband, [Travis](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj), and I created this website a decade ago in an effort to make group swapping easier and more fun, and we have worked hard to keep it running ever since. (Check out our very [first swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/1).) 

**Over the past 10 years Swap-bot has gained more than 65,000 accounts, facilitated more than 200,000 swaps, and received 280 MILLION pageviews! Wow!** 

To celebrate our 10-year milestone, I am hosting a [Swap-bot-themed 10th Anniversary Mail Art Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/206850). I&#8217;d love for it to be a huge swap. Please join us in sending out fun mail art all over the globe!

_**The swap details:** You will have just one partner to whom you will send one piece of Swap-bot-themed mail art. It can be a postcard, letter, or parcel, but it MUST be decorated externally with a Swap-bot theme. Think blue and orange, postal mail images, Ernie the Envie, swap terms, etc. Put some time into making something that will delight our mail carriers! It is not required, but it&#8217;d be fun to include a note or goodies with your mail art for your partner. I&#8217;ve made this a very easy and inclusive swap so that everyone will feel comfortable joining and celebrating Swap-bot. New swappers and experienced members with a 4.9 rating, or higher, are welcome to join this international swap. As always, I will check over participants and remove anyone questionable. **Sign up [HERE](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/206850) by October 1st!**_

Please take a photo of your mail art creation and email it (or a link to it) to me at rachel -at- swap-bot.com. I&#8217;d LOVE to share your artwork here on the Swap-bot blog. Also, check back here for some fun 10th anniversary giveaways very soon!

Swap-bot&#8217;s awesomeness comes from our amazing community of swappers. **Thank you all for swapping with us and supporting us for the last ten years!!**
