So many crafty friends and so few days left before Christmas! What can we give to our creative, swap-loving buddies to celebrate the holiday season? Here are my best ideas&#8230;

  * Greeting cards are always in demand for snail mail enthusiasts. I am especially fond of these [winter cards from Boy Girl Party](http://www.boygirlparty.com/shoppe/mini-edition/item/winterbikecardset.html).
  * Celebrate your friend&#8217;s favorite hobby with a special holiday ornament, like this [glass sewing machine](http://www.christmas-treasures.com/OldWorldChristmas/Catalog/GlassOrnaments/Household/Sewing-Machine-Glass-Ornament-32103.htm?gclid=CKiCh67CqLsCFa9lOgodsnMA7g) or this sweet [painter&#8217;s palette](http://www.bronners.com/product/personalized-paint-palette-glass-ornament.do?green=927C7887-6BBB-58AE-9F60-7BA9355025F0).
  * Stamps!! How about the cute [Gingerbread Houses](http://uspsstamps.com/stamps/gingerbread-houses) or the [Global Forever Evergreen Wreaths](http://uspsstamps.com/stamps/global-forever-evergreen-wreath) from the USPS?!
  * If you are in the mood to splurge, this [Wall-Mounted Craft Organizer](http://www.potterybarn.com/products/wall-mounted-craft-organizer/?pkey=cwall-organization&cm_src=wall-organization||NoFacet-_-NoFacet-_--_-) looks fab.
  * [Washi tape!](http://wishywashi.com) Everyone loves washi tape!
  * Gift a fun and handy project with this [Cross-Stitch iPhone Case Kit](http://www.purlsoho.com/purl/products/item/8967-Leese-Design-iPhone-5-Cases). (Or search [&#8220;craft kits&#8221;](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=craft%20kits&order=most_relevant&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US) on Etsy for more project supply ideas.)
  * A light and convenient [Baggu tote](https://baggu.com/shop/baggu/paintgreen) to carry all their craft supplies and gear in.
  * Fuel for crafting! Everyone loves treats and these [mini cupcakes from Baked by Melissa](http://www.bakedbymelissa.com/checkout/index.aspx) can be shipped all over the US!
  * When in doubt, make your crafty friend something **handmade**! Crafters love crafty gifts! (Or in a real pinch, [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/giftcards/?ref=fp_giftcards) or [Hobby Lobby gift cards](http://shop.hobbylobby.com/gift-card/) would always be a big hit.)

**Good luck with all your gifting & happy, happy holidays!**
