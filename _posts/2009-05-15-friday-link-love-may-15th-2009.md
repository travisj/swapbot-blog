No theme today, just fun links:

  * [Cupcakes Take the Cake](http://cupcakestakethecake.blogspot.com/), a blog all about cupcakes. I met one of the ladies behind this blog (Nichelle) on Monday at Etsy Labs and she was awesome. You can also check out their Etsy store, [Tiny Cupcakes](http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5655961), which sells cupcake-themed goodies for kids.
  * [Craft Corps](http://vickiehowell.com/craftcorps/) &#8211; A brand new project and website by [Vickie Howell](http://vickiehowell.com/) documenting the indie craft movement and profiling crafters. There is going to be a Craft Corps book next year, but in the mean time you can read a new crafter profile each week on the site.
  * Love _Twilight_ ? Love crafts? If you answered yes to both of those questions, you must check out the [Twilight Crafts LiveJournal blog](http://community.livejournal.com/twilight_crafts/) . Most recently, the users were competing in a &#8220;Craft your Food&#8221; contest and making food items from the books.
  * [Craftcast](http://www.craftcast.com/main/) is a podcast site that &#8220;delivers weekly content, covering the latest information in the crafting industry. Listeners get personal time experience with a wide variety of artists and crafters.&#8221;
  * It is summer, time for ice cream! To keep your hands drip-free, check out the [Ice Cream Cone Cozy tutorial](http://theobjectproject.typepad.com/the_object_project/2009/05/ice-cream-cone-cozies-tutorial.html) over at the object project. (via [whip up](http://whipup.net/))
  * Anyone checking out the [Bust Spring Fling Craftacular](http://www.bust.com/Craftacular/BUST-Spring-Fling-Craftacular-2009.html) in Brooklyn on Sunday? Maybe, I&#8217;ll see you there!
