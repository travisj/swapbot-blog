[<img class="alignleft" src='http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/swap1.jpg' alt='swap1.jpg' />](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2053) For those of you who would like to tackle a simple sewing project, I suggest joining the [Spring Apron Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2053). Organized by [purplemorgan](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2228), the Spring Apron Swap is an international swap, but you must have a rating of over 4.7. Each participant has one partner for whom they will sew one &#8220;half apron&#8221;. This is what purplemorgan says about the aprons:

> Have you noticed that aprons are making a comeback? Not the butcher/chef/BBQ style that you can find anywhere, but the more vintage-style hostess/housewife aprons. I LOVE these, and they are SO easy to sew! I&#8217;m brand new to sewing but even I can do it. Make sure you get your assigned partner&#8217;s waist measurements and add plenty of inches to make certain the strings will tie! Also, it&#8217;s always nice to add a few tuck-ins to your package. For this swap, a wooden spoon or other kitchen utensil, potholder, a few recipes or tea bags, any of these would be a lovely little tuck-in surprise for your assigned person. This isn&#8217;t required. All that is required is a simple half apron with one pocket.

You might be able to figure out how to sew one of these aprons on your own if you are an experienced seamstress, but just in case you need some help here are some websites that offer patterns for the cute half aprons and a few other types:
