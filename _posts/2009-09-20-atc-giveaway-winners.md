I loved them so much that I did a private trade with her for 5 more.&#8221;_ Those ATCs sound fabulous. Congrats on your win! (Spinjenny actually entered the drawing twice by , too. Thanks for spreading the word about the &#8216;bot!!)

[**Linda50**](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Linda50): _&#8220;My favorite ATC is one that I received from my sister. She is the person that told me about Swap-bot and she knew it would be good for me. She was so right. Here is a to her ATC. ATC’s are so much fun to do and to receive. I am glad that ATC’s are something that everyone that wants to can do. You do not have to have a ton of supplies and they are not expensive to mail. Just about the perfect little mail art project. Looking thru my ATC album is almost like looking thru a family album. As I look at them I remember who made them and a little about the person as well.&#8221;_

**AndreaSmondria**_</a>: &#8220;my favorite atc that i made was for the i love the 80’s swap, it was of the flock of seagull hair style. it turned out great and i really didn’t want to part with it. But i did and my partner loved it also.&#8221;_ </p> 

Congratulations to the winners! Thank you to everyone for entering. Stay tuned because there will be more giveaways happening in the near future&#8230; (hint: have you seen the ? very cool.)
