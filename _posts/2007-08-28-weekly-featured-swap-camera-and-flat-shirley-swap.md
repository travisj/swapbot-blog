I am always on the look-out for unique swaps to feature&#8230; the [Camera and Flat Shirley Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6794) definitely meets that criteria. The swap is hosted by [funkychicken](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2991) and it is a somewhat complicated two-step swap, so please read the entire swap description before signing up. 

Basically, each participant creates a &#8220;flat shirley&#8221; of themselves &#8211; a small paper body with a picture of themselves for its head, based loosely on the <a h

ref=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060097914/susanreynolar-20&#8243;>Flat Stanley books</a> &#8211; and sends it along with a disposable camera to their partner. The flat shirley stays with the partner for a month and travels around with the person getting its photo taken in various locations. When the month is up, the partner sends back the full camera and flat shirley back to the original creator. This swap should make for some funny and surprising photos of each little &#8220;mini me&#8221;! 

The swap is international, but requires a 4.7 rating or higher. There are more guidelines and detailed information on the [swap's home page](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6794)

  


. Happy swapping!
