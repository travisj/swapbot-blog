lped me pick out this week&#8217;s featured swap: the [Favorite Doggie Treat Recipe Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/113593). This **international** Type 2 mail swap is being hosted by [audreydoll](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:audreydoll) and it is open to new users and those with a 4.85 rating or higher. 

From the swap description:

_Are you a Dog Lover? Do you have a treat or cookie recipe that your pooch just loves? How about sharing? Write your recipe on a pretty decorated card. You can decorate with a pix of your dog, stickers, hand-art &#8211; whatever! You will send your recipe to **three** people and receive three new recipes for you to try. Same recipe to all three, or a different one &#8211; sender&#8217;s choice. Feel free to share something about your dog that makes him or her special to you._ 

What a fun and easy way to get new treat ideas for our furry friends! [Sign up before March 14th.](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/113593)
