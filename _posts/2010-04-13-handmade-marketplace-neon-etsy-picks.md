You can tell from that I am sort of obsessed with neon colors lately. I love to include just a splash of neon in otherwise tame art projects or outfits. So&#8230; I thought it would be fun to search for neon goodies on Etsy. These are some of my favorites:

    <div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-3230px;">
    </div></p>
  </div>
  
  <div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-3883px;">
