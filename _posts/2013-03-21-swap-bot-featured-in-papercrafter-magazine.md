I am excited to share the news that Swap-bot is featured in the current issue of [**PaperCrafter Magazine**](http://www.papercraftermagazine.co.uk)! (It hits UK newsstands on March 28th.) Swap-bot is mentioned on pages 26 & 27 in Elaine Bennett's article, _Going Postal_. The article explains how Swap-bot works and displays [my photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rlj/8432207347/in/set-72157602135475903) of February matchboxes. And, Swap-bot user [Aankee](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Aankee) is interviewed about her postal hobbies on the article sidebar. So cool! I hope the mention attracts a few new European swappers!
