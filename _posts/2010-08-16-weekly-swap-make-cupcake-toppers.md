I am a fan of cupcakes. I love that they are single serving and so darn cute, so I couldn&#8217;t resist signing up for this week&#8217;s featured swap: [Make Cupcake Toppers for Your Partner!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/70014) The international swap is hosted by [thehappyhoneybee](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:thehappyhoneybee), and here are the instructions:

_&#8220;You will create one set of flat cupcake toppers (not 3D so we can keep our postage down by mailing in a regular envelope) with one dozen toppers. These are profile-based cupcake toppers, so have a look through your partner&#8217;s bio and see what kinds of things he or she might enjoy. The toppers can be of your own original design or from any of the free downloadable templates floating out there, just as long as it&#8217;s something nice you&#8217;ve chosen specifically based on your partner&#8217;s likes and dislikes.&#8221;_

If you aren&#8217;t sure how to get started on your toppers, here are a few helpful and inspirational links:
