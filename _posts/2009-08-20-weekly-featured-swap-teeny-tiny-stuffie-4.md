This week&#8217;s swap is the [teeny tiny stuffie swap #4](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/43330) hosted by [Carotte](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Carotte). I can&#8217;t believe there have been three previous version of this swap that I missed! 

For the swap, you send one miniature stuffie (&#8220;It can be sewn, felted, crocheted… if it’s small and &#8216;soft&#8217; it should be ok&#8221;) to one partner. The theme is open, but checking out your partner&#8217;s profile is always cool. More info from the swap description: &#8220;Note that the final stuffie is going to be quite small, so work with care and minutia, and maybe do a test run before joining the swap if you are not sure you can make it. They can use a really small amount of fabric/felt.&#8221; The swap is international, but you must have a 4.9 overall rating, or higher, to participate. Be sure to sign up before the deadline on August 29th! 

For some inspiration, Carotte has some wonderful examples of super-tiny stuffies on her [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/carotte/3682147945/). (I am in love with the little rain cloud!)
