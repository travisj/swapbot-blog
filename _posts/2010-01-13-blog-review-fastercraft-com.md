I stumbled upon the fairly new craft blog, [FasterCraft.com](http://fastercraft.com/), today and I really liked the concept behind the site: quick and easy craft projects that you can fit into your busy schedule. The Faster Craft tag line is &#8220;more crafting, less guilt.&#8221; Here is the site&#8217;s own description:

_Our goal here at Fastercraft is to help you fit crafting into your life. We bring you projects you can do quickly, and help you find ways to make those things fun and as affordable as possible._ 

The site was founded (in November of last year) and is written by Shannon Fugal. It is updated a couple of times per week with links to projects and tutorials, most of which you can complete in just one evening. Shannon&#8217;s motivation behind starting Faster Craft &#8212; her experience of wasting time at the craft store sounds familiar! I look forward to reading more of her posts!
