In an attempt to spread the good word about Swap-bot and to learn more about running an online business, I sometimes attend conferences. You may remember my posts about [Blogher in 2010](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/08/13/friday-link-love-blogher-edition/) and [BlogHer Handmade](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/09/16/friday-link-love-blogher-handmade/) last year. Last week, I was at [BlogHer 2012](http://www.blogher.com/blogher-12) right here in New York City, and I picked up a few **links** for you:

  * Martha Stewart was one of the keynote speakers. She was as <del datetime="2012-08-07T16:04:18+00:00">arrogant</del> confident as ever, but she was also really funny. She is definitely a hard worker and I think she might be a genius. Anyhoo, she has a new show, [Martha Stewart's Cooking School](http://www.themarthablog.com/2012/07/introducing-my-new-show-martha-stewarts-cooking-school-at-the-tca-press-tour.html), starting in October on PBS. It looks very lovely.
  * Not a blog, but maybe a helpful tool: [RescueTime](http://www.rescuetime.com/). Track how you spend your time online and be more productive.
  * [Girl Around Town](http://www.girlaroundtown.net/) &#8211; A women's lifestyle site (similar to [Daily Candy](http://www.dailycandy.com/everywhere/)) covering NYC, Houston, and LA.

**Blogs:**

  * [An Acorn Dreaming](http://www.acorndreaming.com/)
  * [All Things Angela](http://everythingangela.blogspot.com/)

  * [Let Me Start By Saying&#8230;](http://letmestartbysayingblog.com/)

**Now for the GIVEAWAY!**

Like usual, attendees received quite a bit of swag at BlogHer 2012. I didn't want to be greedy this year, but I did get some fun stuff, as seen below. And, I have a SURPRISE group of goodies to send to one lucky Swap-botter! The surprise swag grab bag will NOT include everything you see below, but it does include some great stuff, plus a healthy dose of Swap-bot postcards, pins, and stickers. Fun!
