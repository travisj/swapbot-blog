Do you want to break into the world of zines? This week&#8217;s featured swap, [Mini-&#8216;zine swap #6](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/39289), will help you do just that! This beginner-friendly, international zine swap is being hosted by [zoey1440](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:zoey1440) and the sign up deadline is coming up very soon on July 12th! After signing up, you&#8217;ll have a little less than a month to get your zine finished and sent out. 

The [Mini-&#8216;zine swap #6](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/39289) description says it all:

_&#8220;Whether you are new to zines or a pro, this is a swap to share your unique mini-zine and also send each other your comments. This is a great way to start out if you are new to this or help each other with ideas and tips. In this swap you will create a mini-zine (1 page folded into 8 mini-pages) and send to 5 partners. Can be color or black-and-white, pics or text, whatever you like! Format is also your choice &#8211; make it unique to you!! Journal style, mini-articles, photos, recipes, news, opinions, absolutely anything goes!! Newbies are welcome, we all had to start somewhere!!&#8221;_ 

Zines are handmade, indie magazines that are usually produced in multiple, so you will be sending copies of your single finished product to all five of your partners in the swap. The mini zine format (made from a single sheet of 8.5 x 11 inch paper) is a great way to try out making zines without requiring a huge commitment or a huge amount of content. There are some great mini zine tutorial videos [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh1W15BWCUk) and [here](http://www.knowledgeup.com/2007/11/05/diy-mini-8-page-pocket-zine/) to help get you started. Have fun expressing yourself in zine form!
