Do you love photography? Do you use one of the cool photo apps like [instagram](http://instagr.am/) or [hipstamatic](http://hipstamatic.com/) to take funky, square photos on your iPhone? (I took the photo above with instagram.) Do you wish you could get equally cool prints of those photos? Now you can with [PostalPix](http://postalpix.com/index.html)!! 

Let&#8217;s swap our photo prints in the **[PostalPix Photo Print Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/102484)**!!

They mail premium prints directly to your home. To download the app, just search &#8220;PostalPix&#8221; in the App Store or  follow <a href=http://bit.ly/qJBnFJ">this link</a>.

Ordering prints is as easy as selecting your desired size, picking photos from your camera roll, and checking out with a credit card or Paypal. [Here&#8217;s a list of the print formats PostalPix offers.](https://www.facebook.com/PostalPix?sk=app_4949752878)

**For this swap, you&#8217;ll be sending three (3) 4&#215;4 or 4&#215;6 prints to each of your two (2) partners, for a total of six (6) prints sent. The theme and style of the photos is totally up to you!**

You can either have PostalPix mail the prints to your own home then repackage them and mail them on to your partners, or mail prints to your partners directly from the app. 

PostalPix is sponsoring this swap and giving all participants **25% off** their photo print orders. I will send an email to all participants after the sign up deadline with the coupon code for the discount.

**Details:** New and experienced swappers are welcome. However anyone with recent low ratings or questionable behavior will be removed. This swap is for US residence only because PostalPix can currently only ship to US addresses. Also, you must have an iPhone in order to be able to use the PostalPix app. [Sign up now!](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/102484)
