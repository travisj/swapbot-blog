Two of your fellow swappers have generously offered to share some free downloadable templates with you. Check &#8217;em out!

This matchbox template was created by Swap-bot user, [HelenJoy](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:HelenJoy). It is for the larger, 250-count matchbox (approximately 4.75 x 2.75 x1.2 inches in size). Click on the image to go to the correct (larger) image size for the template. Then, save it to your computer and print it out &#8211; make sure to print it at 100%, not &#8220;scale to fit page.&#8221; (The template with both parts won&#8217;t fit on a single 8.5 x 11 piece of paper so you will either need cut it apart in an image editing program or download the two parts [here](http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/250matchbox_inside.jpg) and [here](http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/250matchbox_outside.jpg).) The larger matchboxes need to be constructed from something stiffer than card stock, like a cereal box or light cardboard. Let us know if you have any tips or suggestions for constructing them successfully.

Another great download comes from user, [IlonaH](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:IlonaH). She has created an ATC basics kit which is free for download on her personal website. [Click here to be taken to &#8220;My other life,&#8221; Ilona&#8217;s blog and the place where you can download her kit.](http://sokkiesspot.blogspot.com/2009/07/bit-of-whimsys-christmas-in-july-give.html) Her kit has an ATC template, plus some digital papers that she has created to get you started making Artist Trading Cards on the computer. A very cool freebie for those interested in trying out some digital crafting! 

Thank you, Helen and Ilona, for your nice work and generosity! If there is anyone else out there who would like to share any free templates, patterns, or tutorials, please let me know (email rachel [at] swap-bot.com). I would love to share your projects on the blog.
