I had a hard time finding links this weeks. It seems that crafters are much more into Halloween than Thanksgiving&#8230; as always, add more fun links in the comments!

  * Make a holiday [Yarn Ball Wreath with this pretty tutorial](http://iseelifethroughalens.blogspot.com/2010/11/yarn-ball-ornament-wreath-tutorial.html).
