I received them on the [Chocomania swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/108060) package from my partner, [sanna](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sanna). I have really been enjoying international swaps lately and I have been saving all of the stamps for my collection. Do you keep the stamps you get on packages?This week, I have another wide variety of links for you. Enjoy:   * Have you seen the [Random Tutorial Generator](http://random-tutorial.com/)? It pops out a new, random craft project with each click.  * Need a fun, candy-less Valentine for the kiddos? Check out this free, downloadable [Valentine Crown](http://www.skiptomylou.org/2012/01/25/printable-valentine-crown/) from Skip to my Lou.  * One of my new favorite craft blogs: [A Girl Who Makes](http://www.agirlwhomakes.com/).  * Cool.
