This week, I am featuring two versions of a very unique swap idea, both hosted by [pahasiga](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pahasiga):

[**Fun &#8220;Mathbox&#8221; for math lovers**](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/72613)

and

[**Fun &#8220;Mathbox&#8221; for math haters**](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/72614)

The idea for these two swaps came when pahasiga kept misspelling the word &#8220;matchbox&#8221; and thought it must be a sign to create a math swap. Math is all around us! Why not incorporate it into our swaps?! 

The swap directions are pretty simple: **1) take a box**, and **2) decorate it and fill with fun math**. But what exactly is fun math? Here is a description from the swap&#8230;

_&#8220;There are things that you maybe have never thought to have a connection to math. A round button with stripes on it? &#8211; it is a circle with chords dividing it into segments &#8211; very mathematical! Beads that are all round (spheres) or long ones (cylinders), inchies (squares) and ATCs (rectangles)&#8230; Unsharpened pencils are prisms or cylinders, and when they are sharpened, then they are prisms or cylinders with a cone on one end. And I won&#8217;t even start on ribbons &#8211; I swear I have read about a way of building up all geometry from ribbons.</p> 

Also, there are any kind of math-related jokes; funny, fake or just interesting math problems; math puzzles &#8211; logic problems, sudokus of all kinds, KenKen, Slither link, nonograms, light up, Hashiwokakero (bridges), Shikaku (rectangles), Nurikabe (Islands in the Stream), Dominosa, mazes, Kakuro, fill-in-crosswords, etc etc etc. 

You can cut problems out of magazines or books, copy/remake from them (giving credit where due), or even create the jokes/problems/puzzles yourself. Don&#8217;t stuff your box with only one kind of things &#8211; let there be at least four kinds of fun math in the box, and let there be at least one math of a puzzle type &#8211; not only buttons and beads.&#8221;</i>

In the [Math Lovers swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/72613) you can include difficult math problems in your box. In the [Math Haters swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/72614), only send the easiest of puzzles. Both swaps have a sign up deadline of this Sunday, September 19th. You must have over a 4.9 rating, with at least three ratings for package swaps, to sign up. Show your math love and swap some math fun!
