Swap-bot is ever-changing and we have some new improvements to tell you about: 

<em style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?air_force_one">Air Force One movie</a></em> </p> 

  * Biggest Deal &#8211; There is now a &#8220;latest discussions&#8221; for all of your group forums. When you go to Group Forums Home you will now see a list of the 25 most recent forum conversations from all of the groups you belong to. (Sticky conversations are listed first.) The latest group discussions take the place of the simple list of group names that used to be on the Group Forums Home. There is also now a link to your group forums on the public forums sidebar.
  * Woot woot! There are now a couple of group email notifications! You will now receive email notifications whenever a new swap is created in one of the groups you belong to. You will also receive an email when a new announcement is posted in any of your groups. (Announcements are the comments listed on the group homepage. The idea is that founders and officers could use the announcements section to post things that they would like to notify the entire group about.) Both of these email notifications are completely optional. You can choose which type of emails you would like to receive for each group. Go to the new &#8220;Groups&#8221; link within the &#8220;Profile Edit&#8221; page in order to set your group email preferences. The default is set so that you DO receive ALL of the group email notifications.
  * Speaking of editing your profile, in addition to the &#8220;edit&#8221; link at the top of most Swap-bot pages there is now a new link on your profile page that will take you to the edit screen. Some users were having trouble finding the profile edit page, so hopefully this will make it easier.
