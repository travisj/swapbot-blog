I want to share a very creative swap for all of us who love postal mail and stamps. It is the [Inspired by Postage Stamps Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/113050) hosted by [MichelleWillow](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MichelleWillow) in which you make a booklet all about stamps for your partner. (Above is a stamp from MichelleWillow&#8217;s collection.)

**From the swap description:**

_For this swap you&#8217;ll have 1 partner and make for them one little green (recycled) booklet with things you learned through the postage stamps!</p> 

Select 10 postage stamps from ANY country except your own and your partner&#8217;s (used is preferred!!!), look up for the story behind the image on the stamp and write it down in your booklet.

**Rules for making booklets:**

  * booklet should be at least 6 &#8221; x 4&#8243;
  * booklet has to be handmade and 100% made of recycled materials (you can use for covers: greeting cards, thin cardboard from cereal boxes, etc. / for pages: old book pages, magazine pages, junk mail, leaflets, etc. / for writing: hand written, hand drawn or clips from magazines or books)
  * it&#8217;s strictly forbidden to use computer to print out images / text!!! No stickers! (unless they are recycled from envelopes and such)
  * try to keep story behind each stamp on separate page and don&#8217;t forget to glue a stamp along with a story!
