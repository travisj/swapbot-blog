They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [Rocktopus](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Rocktopus)!** Rocktopus lives near Houston, Texas, and has been swapping for four years. She loves watercolor, jewelry, and collecting lots of things, like nature items and coins.

**How Rocktopus found Swap-bot:** &#8221; I was searching for a penpal system after seeing an article on the lost art of letter-writing, I was blessed with a link to this site.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;Meeting new friends from around the globe, connecting on a personal level with so many wonderful people, fitting a swap to a profile, learning a new craft (I bought my sewing machine because of this site!) and of course receiving mail that is not bills! &#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;It&#8217;s a close call between ATC&#8217;s and profile-based private swaps. I love to do any swap that is time-intensive, especially if it&#8217;s for a new craft. Private swaps are my favorite because you can tailor so specifically to your partner!&#8221; 

**Check out some of Rocktopus&#8217; cool steampunk-style ATCs:**

**And two of her Harry Potter-themed swaps:**

**And her cute mail art:**

**Interesting facts about Rocktopus:** &#8220;I Geocache as a hobby, think of it as a giant treasure hunt that spans continents! I collect lots of things, butterflies, coins, bones, stamps and ATC&#8217;s. I work as a Title I Aide for an elementary school. I used to be terrified of sewing machines, but the &#8216;Bot helped me conquer that fear! I have two sweet cats but would love twenty! I am engaged to be married March 2015 to the love of my life. I love to send out elaborately decorated swaps/gifts.&#8221;
