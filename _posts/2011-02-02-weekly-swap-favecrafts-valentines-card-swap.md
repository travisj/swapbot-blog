[FaveCrafts.com](http://www.favecrafts.com/) is an awesome craft website that has thousands of free craft projects, home decor ideas, and DIY tips. I have subscribed to their email newsletter for quite a while and was super-pumped when they [announced](http://www.favecraftsblog.com/special-announcement-introducing-the-favecrafts-valentine-card-swap/) their [FaceCrafts Valentine&#8217;s Card Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/81159).

For the swap, each participant creates three Valentine&#8217;s cards &#8212; one for each of their three partners. &#8220;Cards can be designed and made however you want, as long as they&#8217;re homemade. This means die-cutting, sewing, photo-shopping, glitter, etc. Make sure the design you choose is easy enough to make multiples of, because you&#8217;ll have to make 3.&#8221; The swap is a great way to get your creative juices flowing and get some lovely Valentine&#8217;s mail in return!

The [FaceCrafts Valentine&#8217;s Card Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/81159) is currently in the &#8220;Top Swap&#8221; position on Swap-bot, with over 90 participants already signed up! But, there is still time to participate! Sign up for the swap before this Friday, February 4th, and start spreading the Valentine&#8217;s Day love!

_p.s. Friday is also the last day to sign up for the [I Love Swap-bot Ultimate Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/82038) and get your bonus pack of Swap-bot goodies!_
