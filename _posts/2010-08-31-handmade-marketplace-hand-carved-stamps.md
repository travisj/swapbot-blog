The hand carved stamp seen above was made by Swap-bot member, [Missthundercat](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:missthundercat). Isn&#8217;t it cute?! It is hard to find a hand carved stamp that isn&#8217;t cute or interesting in its own way, and there are many for sale on [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/). Here are some of my favorites&#8230;

Have you ever carved your own stamps? I have made a couple, but I want to get back into it&#8230; perhaps I should join the [Hand Carved Stamps Swap-bot group](http://www.swap-bot.com/group/4ff52db0b81f90101ebc118bb65dcf01/about).
