_&#8220;Cafe Handmade is like a traditional craft show, but better. You can now attend a craft show at your leisure, as often as you would like, and have the same experience as a traditional craft show with featured artist interviews, artist demonstrations, giveaways, and more.&#8221;_ 

There are a lot of craft websites out in the vast internet universe &#8211; more than most folks can keep up with &#8211; which is why a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; site like [Cafe Handmade](http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/) is so handy and fun! [Cafe Handmade](http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2008/11/about-us.html) was created in November of 2008 by husband and wife team, Len and Kerri Testa. Their original goal was to create &#8220;a place where crafters and artists could show off their creations&#8221; and to promote buying handmade. 

Cafe Handmade is more than just &#8220;a weekly virtual craft show.&#8221; There are also feature articles with interviews from [artists](http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2009/04/featured-artist-mari-forssell-stash.html) and [mommaprenuers](http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2009/04/mommaprenuer-audrey-hussey-kaboogie.html), [weekly giveaways](http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2009/04/giveaway-sponsored-by-arys-naturals.html), [the Lounge](http://cafehandmade.ning.com/) (a social network just for handmade aficionados), artist demos, and a [marketplace](http://cafehandmade.bluefuzzyslippers.com/) where you can purchase handmade goods. The [Virtual Craft Show](http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2009/03/virtual-craft-show-aisle-1.html) displays the work of dozens of artists and crafters with lots of lovely photos of their products. The wares range from jewelry and clothing to bakery treats and bath items. The [Cafe Handmade craft show](http://cafehandmade.blogspot.com/2009/03/virtual-craft-show-aisle-1.html) is a great place to find new-to-you artists and unique handmade products.
