Do you collect fabric, sewing patterns, yarn, or other textile and fiber art supplies? Are you always looking for more unique items to add to your collection? Or, would you like to reduce your growing stash by selling a few items? Let me introduce you to [Stash Slash](https://www.stashslash.com/index.asp)! 

Stash Slash is _&#8220;an ad-free community for fiber and fabric lovers providing a dedicated market so you can sell your unneeded stash &#8212; or buy fabrics, yarns, adornments, notions, patterns, books and accessories with an easy-to-use process from beginning to end. All sewers, quilters, knitters, weavers, basketmakers and fiber artists are invited to join. For a low-cost yearly selling membership the market is yours &#8212; without any listing or end-of-sale fees.&#8221;_
