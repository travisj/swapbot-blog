_Dannielle Molesworth aka on Mar 17th, 2010:</p> 

For my Craft Month Celebration I am volunteering at a local nursing home for arts & crafts. Teaching and assiting the elderly with a craft I donated. So many do not have any visitors and they love to recieve things or make things they can keep. I felt that was a great way to celebrate craft month. </i> 

Congrats to Dannielle! She will receive a wonderful selection of items handmade by Biasbabe.
