This week&#8217;s featured swap is the [magic yarn ball SUMMER swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/38391) 

hosted by [honeybknits](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:honeybknits) .

What is a magic yarn ball? It is a skein of yarn wrapped into a ball around tiny treasures like candy, stitch markers, trinkets, etc. As your partner uses the yarn in their knitting or crochet project, the little presents will fall out for them to enjoy! The [magic yarn ball SUMMER swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/38391) obviously has a summer theme. All of the trinkets and treasures contained in your yarn ball should have some connection to summer. The swap is international and you have until June 19th to sign up, but be sure to read the full swap description. There is a short list of questions on the swap page that each participant must answer in order to participate. Happy swapping!
