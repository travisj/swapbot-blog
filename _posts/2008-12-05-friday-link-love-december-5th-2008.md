We are solidly into December and the holidays are approaching faster than the speed of light! You probably don&#8217;t have time for any distractions, but here are some anyway:

  * With the economy officially in a recession we could all use a few more ideas for how to make and/or save a little extra money. [Secrets For Money](http://www.secretsformoney.info/) is a great source of ideas, tips, and strategies &#8220;To increase your capacity for all wealth currencies: money, time, health, and love.&#8221;
  * Are you a style maven? A design diva? Any combination of the two? If so, you will like [StyleDiva.com](http://www.stylistdiva.com/) &#8212; a blog all about fashion, design, style advice, and more!
  * Another great blog for all of us crafty souls: [The Best of DIY](http://www.thebestofdiy.com/). It has reviews and links to all sorts of DIY projects.
  * Online magazines are all the rage. [Craftier](http://acraftierworld.com/) is a new bi-monthly online magazine that is getting great reviews. &#8220;The goal of the writers and editors is to make the world a craftier place through tutorials, inspiration, spotlights and community involvement.&#8221; You have to use the flash application, [Issuu](http://issuu.com/craftier/docs/vol1issue3), to view the mag, which may slow up on some computers and internet connections, but it is worth it for all the great images and tutorials. (Plus they mentioned Swap-bot on page 38 of the current issue! sweet!)
