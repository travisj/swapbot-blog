Join the [Paper Doll Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76062) hosted by [Dakini55](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Dakini55) and create two, handmade, jointed, paper dolls for your partner. The swap is international and open to anyone with a 4.9 rating, or higher. The dolls can be of any style, but must be between 5 and 9 inches tall. Sign up before November 12th, and then you have nearly a month to create your dolls and get them sent by December 10th.
