This week&#8217;s featured swap is the very unique and creative [Your Day Word Search swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/28457) coordinated by [beckra](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:beckra) . For this swap you create an original word search puzzle for each of your two parners based on words from your everyday life. From the swap description:

> &#8220;In this swap you&#8217;ll turn your day into a sweet game for your 2 partners. Choose a particular day and come up with a list of about 15 words which relate to your experiences, emotions, and/or activities on that day. Then create a (typed) word search in which you&#8217;ve embedded those words. Include a brief description/explanation for each word on your list so that your partners get a window-via-words into your daily life.&#8221;

The [Your Day Word Search swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/28457) is an international postal mail swap. New users and established swappers with at least 4.95 rating are welcome to join.
