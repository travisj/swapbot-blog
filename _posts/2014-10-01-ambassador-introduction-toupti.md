They are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [Toupti](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Toupti)!** Toupti lives in Montreal, Québec, Canada, and has been a member of Swap-bot since 2009. Wow! She speaks French and English, and she volunteers as a [Chemo Angel](http://chemoangels.wix.com/chemo-angels-1/). 

**Ambassador Region:** Québec, Canada

**How Toupti found Swap-bot:** &#8220;So easy to remember since I found it at work. I am a customs officer inspecting incoming parcels in Canada looking for prohibited merchandise. At some point, I remember inspecting a parcel filled with nice handmade goodies and there was a note inside mentioning &#8216;…for our private swap on swap-bot.&#8217; I got curious and wanted to receive such nice packages so when I got back home after work, I googled &#8216;swap-bot&#8217; and found it!&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;For many reasons, but the main one is that it gave me an opportunity to discover crochet and also develop my crafting skills. I also got to meet amazing people and make new friends.&#8221;

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;Private profile related swaps and one-on-one swaps.&#8221;
