wap-bot needs a rating system. I am thinking of trying something based on Yahoo's [Rating an Object](http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/pattern_ratinganobject.php) design pattern.

I envision a system that _somehow_ shows you the name of of your swap partner after you receive your item and allows you to rate the swapper. The rating would take the following into account:

  * quality of swapped item
  * the swappers ability to swap on-time
  * _what else?_

This rating could then be used to allow people into or deny people from entering a swap. The swap creator could specify a rating of at least 3.5 (or any value) to enter the swap. I would think that the rating limit would apply to anyone with at least three swaps under their belt (eg: less than three swaps and the rating does not apply to them, they automatically get into the swap). All ratings would have to be public and some sort of appeals process would need to be in place. 

The only question I really have is: at what point can the ratings begin? Since we have to reveal the name of the person you are rating, at which point in the swap process do you want to see the name. We've discussed before that you should see this name after 30 days, but is this too long after the swap to start rating?

Ideas and feedback please.
