We also just created a new [SwapbotNews](https://twitter.com/SwapbotNews) twitter account. With the new account we can announce fun swap-bot stuff without it getting lost within all of the new swap tweets. I plan to only tweet about once or twice a day with the [SwapbotNews](https://twitter.com/SwapbotNews) account, so you can follow without the fear of being bombarded with too many tweets. 

I am going to announce a new Swap-bot Giveaway early next week that will utilize Twitter in some way, so get ready by following [SwapbotNews](https://twitter.com/SwapbotNews) now!

(Other Twitter fun facts: you can follow [me](https://twitter.com/rljart) and [Crusher](https://twitter.com/crusherdog), and crafty stuff like [Etsy](https://twitter.com/etsy) and [Craft Critique](https://twitter.com/CraftCritique), as well as famous folks like [Oprah](https://twitter.com/Oprah) and [Martha](https://twitter.com/MarthaStewart)! Fun!)
