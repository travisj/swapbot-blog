Hi, hi, hi! Life is getting busy around the Swap-bot HQ, but I managed to scrounge up a few interesting links for you to check out. (Also, we plan to release a few site changes/improvements on Sunday, so stay tuned!)

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://howtogetyourexfriendback.com">click here</a> How to win back your ex
</div>

  * A fun and helpful [holiday gift guide](http://designismine.blogspot.com/) from Design is Mine. It features independent designers and craft people. Tons of great stuff!
  * [Vintage Sewing Patterns wiki](http://vintagepatterns.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page) created by Erin from [A Dress a Day](http://www.dressaday.com/2007/11/and-we-have-achieved-wiki.html). (A wiki is a community-edited website.) The plan for the wiki is that it will include links to sellers who have particular patterns in stock, reviews by people who have made the patterns, links to blog posts about particular patterns, a wishlist of people who want to buy or trade particular patterns, and searchable 'tags' on patterns (like 'cocktail', 'wrap dress', 'peter pan collar' or whatever). (via [Craft:blog](http://www.craftzine.com/blog/).)
  * [Softies Central](http://softiescentral.typepad.com/blog/) was hosting a Holiday Softie Contest and [the results are up](http://softiescentral.typepad.com/blog/2007/11/and-the-winners.html). There are some really cute and creative holiday characters! (via <a href=http://whipup.net/">Whip Up</a>.)
  * If you are into print design like me you might be interested in the [Best Magazine Covers of 2007](http://www.magazine.org/editorial/24689.cfm) as chosen by the [American Society of Magazine Editors](http://www.magazine.org/Editorial/). (via [kottke.org](http://www.kottke.org/).)

Have a great weekend! xoxo
