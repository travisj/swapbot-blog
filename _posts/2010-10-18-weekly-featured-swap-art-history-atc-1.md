If you enjoy art history you should join the [Art History ATC Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74412) hosted by [tyttoastronautti](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:tyttoastronautti). The swap is the first in what hopes to be a series of art history-inspired swaps. Each swap in the series will be inspired by a different period in art history, the first one being **Art Nouveau**. 

[Art Nouveau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau) is an international movement and style of art that was most popular at the turn of the 20th century. It is characterized by organic, especially floral and other plant-inspired motifs, as well as highly stylized, flowing curvilinear forms. Artists include Alphonse Mucha, Louis Comfort Tiffany, and Gustav Klimt, among many others.

The [Art History ATC Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74412) is international and each participant makes one art nouveau ATC for their one partner. You must have completed at least three mail swaps and have a 4.8 rating, or higher, to join. Sign up before October 30th.
