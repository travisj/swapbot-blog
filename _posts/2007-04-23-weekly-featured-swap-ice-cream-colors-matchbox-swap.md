Ok, if you have ever checked out my [personal blog](http://www.rljart.com/blog/), you know that I am a sucker for the pastel colors. Because of that fact, I couldn&#8217;t resist choosing the [Ice Cream Colors Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3396) for this week&#8217;s featured swap. I completed my fist matchbox swap a week ago and my little matchbox is on its way to Australia. I can&#8217;t wait to start on my next one! 

The [Ice Cream Colors Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3396) is coordinated by [ellawitch](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=5464). Here are the rules:

> This swap is to decorate and fill a 32-count matchbox using what I call &#8220;Ice Cream Colors&#8221;. The matchbox and it&#8217;s contents must be done in chocolate brown and one of the following colors: light pink, mint, light yellow, light blue, aqua or lavender. You can do more than a two color combination but it has to be chocolate brown and at least one of the other colors.

This swap is international, but there are some other rules and restrictions, so make sure you read the entire description before signing up. People fill their matchboxes with all sorts of things, including buttons, beads, brads, stickers, sequins, pins, ribbon, candies, little embellishments, etc&#8230; anything miniature and cute is acceptable! <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I know that I can&#8217;t wait to start putting together my ice creamy matchbox, but in case you need some inspiration, here is some delicious ice cream for you:
