Another week, another awesome list of links!

  * My friend, [Jessica](http://jessicaalfieri.com/) made the blueberry cobbler cookie seen above, and she shares the [recipe](http://www.acedepartment.com/blog/2011/04/15/bluebird/) over on AceDept.com. I want to make some this weekend!
  * Want to make something a little less healthy? How about these [homemade Twix-style cookie bars](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/thousand-dollar-bars-recipe) from King Arthur Flour?!
  * I love this free, printable, [Easter goodie box](http://melissaesplin.com/home/2011/04/freebie-easter-candy-box/) over on I Still Love You.
  * And this [Spring Flower Garland](http://www.infarrantlycreative.net/2011/03/spring-flower-garland.html) tutorial over on Infarrantly Creative.
  * Have an cute spring project that your shared on your blog? Add your link to the [Craftaholics Anonymous Spring Link Party](http://www.craftaholicsanonymous.net/2011/04/spring-has-sprung-linky-party.html). Or, just check out the dozens of other fun projects.
  * Inspiration for the home: [bookshelf styling ideas](http://littlegreennotebook.blogspot.com/2011/04/inspiration-book-shelf-styling.html).
  * One of the coolest things I&#8217;ve seen done with paper: [a record player wedding invite](http://kellianderson.com/blog/2011/04/a-paper-record-player/). So cool!
  * These [ombre beaded necklaces](http://www.marthastewart.com/article/mesh-ombre-necklace?xsc-=eml_crd_2011_04_10) on Martha Stewart Crafts are so beautiful. The tutorial looks like an advanced beading project, but I might try it.
