This week&#8217;s featured swap is for those of you who consider writing an art form, a creative endeavor, a craft, or all three! The swap is [Writing From Life](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/39817) hosted by Swap-bot user, [junemoon](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:junemoon). I really like how junemoon describes the swap, so I am going to quote from the swap&#8217;s description:

_&#8220;Artists draw live models and go outside to paint landscapes even if they are going to become abstract artists. Writers need to write from life no matter what kind of writing they hope to do. This is a life-writing exercise. Here&#8217;s what you do&#8230;</p> 

Take a notebook and pen and go to a place where you will see people you don&#8217;t know. Spent at least 15 minutes, more if you like, writing about the people you see, describing them as well as you can in the time they are visible. Go home and think a bit about the people you&#8217;ve written about, maybe make more notes about them.

Write a short story about two of the people you described. The story will start this way: they are sitting side by side on a long plane ride. One says to the other, &#8216;May I tell you&#8230;&#8217; What is the story or secret? How does the other react? Or, what if the second person says, &#8216;No&#8217;? Don&#8217;t quit writing if s/he does, tell us what goes through both people&#8217;s minds. Does the first tell the story anyway? Does the second get curious and ask to hear? Make our story at least two double spaced pages, longer if you want.&#8221;</i>

What a great writing prompt! It sounds like a fantastic way to get your creative juices flowing, even if you don&#8217;t consider yourself a writer! 

The swap is open for sign up through July 10th, and then you have a month to complete your story and get in mailed out to your partner. The swap is international, but you must have a high rating with no flaking. Remember to read the full [swap description](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/39817) before committing to the swap. Happy writing!
