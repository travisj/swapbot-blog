We are already a quarter of the way through October and Halloween will be here before we know it! I need to start planning my costume&#8230;

**Halloween Stuff:**

  * Yum! Don&#8217;t these [Halloween Layered Cake Balls](http://sugarturntable.com/?p=1718) look tasty and fun?! The Sugar Turntable has a bunch of great [Halloween recipes](http://sugarturntable.com/?page_id=1347), like these [Candy Corn Cupcakes](http://sugarturntable.com/?p=1401)
