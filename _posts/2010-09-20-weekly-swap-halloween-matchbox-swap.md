This week, I am being a little bit selfish and featuring my own swap, the [Happy Halloween Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/70350). It is a fairly self-explanitory matchbox swap: send one Halloween-themed matchbox to your one partner. There are already more than 60 people signed up &#8211; yay! &#8211; and anyone with a 4.8, or higher, rating is welcome to join. Sign up before September 30th and send your matchbox before October 15th. I always love Halloween matchboxes &#8211; they end up being so creative!

Halloween is a popular swap theme every year. Here are a few more Halloween swaps you might want to check out:
