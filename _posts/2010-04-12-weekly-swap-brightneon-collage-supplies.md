Like many of us, I remember when neon was hot in the 80s and early 90s &#8211; I had a neon green snap bracelet and cool neon pink and black sunglasses &#8211; radical! Well, neon and other bright colors are back in style&#8230; if used in moderation, of course, and this week&#8217;s featured swap is right on trend. It is the swap hosted by . For the swap, you simply send an envelope full of brightly colored craft and collage items to each of your three partners.
