This is going to be a two-week version of Friday Link Love since I missed last week&#8217;s post. I have divided the links into a few categories: freebies, bookmark sites, tutorials, and just plain cool sites. I hope you find something you love!

**Freebie Downloads & Printables:**

  * Creature Comforts always has nice free downloads, but these by Suzy from are especially nice.
  * These black and white on Got Crafts? seem extremely versatile and user-friendly. 
  * Speaking of labels, I really love these from Dandy Bread and Candy (seen in action in the image above). 
  * A darling, little free for download at The Small Object.

**Crafty Bookmarking Sites:**

  * If you need a place to find interesting craft links and keep track of our favorite articles and places on the web, check out . It is a place where you can submit links to anything craft-related and the users vote on which items they like most. (You can vote for , if you are so inclined.)
  * is a very similar site, but with amazingly cute graphics. It is a social bookmarking site for crafters where you submit links and the most popular ones rise to the top. (You can also vote for on Craftig. Thanks!)

**Tutorials:**

  * Very hip on Happy Together.
  * Cute and clever from Chica and Jo.
  * on Gingham Cherry &#8211; use one instead of ribbon on your next package!
  * A really pretty by Wren Handmade.
  * Some tips on how to do to preserve your artwork on the Etsy Storque.

**Cool Websites:**

  * 
  * &#8211; a blog full of crafty recycling projects.
