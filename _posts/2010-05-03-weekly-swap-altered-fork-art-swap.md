It is just what it sounds like: art made from altered metal forks. You can view some examples of the art form on [www.fork-art.com](http://www.fork-art.com/).

This week&#8217;s featured swap is the [Altered Fork Art Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/59601) hosted by [pummica](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:pummica), and I believe it is the first time a fork art swap has been hosted on Swap-bot. For this international swap, each participant creates one piece of fork art for their one partner using at least one metal fork. &#8220;You can paint them, bend them, make holes in them. Your art can be more than just one and you can ad non-fork things to it but the bulk of the art should be the fork.&#8221; It definitely sounds like an interesting new art form to try out! If you want to give it a try, sign up for the swap now &#8211; the sign up deadline is this Wednesday, May 5th! Make sure to read the full [swap desctiption](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/59601) for the full requirements.
