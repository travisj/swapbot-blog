A reminder for any local Pacific Northwest swappers, this weekend is the Swap-bot Member Appreciation Event! 

The event will be held on Sunday, March 1st, from 12 &#8211; 3 pm at the Lamb Cottage in Skinner Butte Park ([address: 101 Cheshire Ave, Eugene OR 97401](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=101+Cheshire+Ave,+Eugene+OR+97401&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=61.669968,87.363281&ie=UTF8&ll=44.060607,-123.095584&spn=0.027817,0.042658&z=15) ). It is a charming location (right by the Willamette River in the park) with plenty of parking. The plan is to have balloons on the outside of the cottage so that you know where the party is at!

Most of the event will consist of meeting each other and socializing, but there are a few organized activities, too. On the (very loose) agenda for the event is a short talk by [Travis](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj) & [Rachel](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson) about Swap-bot with plenty of time for questions, an altered matchbox construction demo, a few announcements from local crafters and businesses, and an ATC trade facilitated by Swap-bot member [coffeelatte](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:coffeelatte) at 2 pm. Remember to bring your ATCs if you would like to trade! 

There will be snacks and beverages, plus some amazing door prizes donated by our fabulous sponsors.
