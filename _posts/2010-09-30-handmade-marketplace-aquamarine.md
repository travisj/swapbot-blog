I love aquamarine gem stones. Turquoise is my favorite color and I am always drawn to the lightly colored stones&#8230; so pretty. The beautiful aquamarine necklace above is from the [Kahili Creations Etsy shop](http://www.etsy.com/shop/KahiliCreations?ref=seller_info). It is so simple, yet unique! Here are some more handmade, aquamarine (some real gem stones, some not) jewelry picks from Etsy&#8230;

What is your favorite gem stone? Do you have a favorite jewelry maker on Etsy or another handmade marketplace?
