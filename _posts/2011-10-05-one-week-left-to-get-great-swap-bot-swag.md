Travis ([travisj](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj)) and I are still training hard for the [Marine Corps Marathon](http://www.marinemarathon.com/) in Washington DC on October 30th. Only 3.5 weeks until the event! Wow!

We are also still raising money for [The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society](http://www.lls.org/)&#8230;. but only for **one more week**! This is your **last chance** to “purchase” a special Swap-bot swag package by donating to the LLS via our [**TNT Fundraising page**](http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis). 

I will mail the following pack of items to anyone who donates **$10 or more** via our [TNT Fundraising page](http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis) by October 12th:

  * 10 Ernie the Envie postcards
  * 3 NEW &#8220;Sealed with Love&#8221; postcards
  * 2 “Love Snail Mail” postcards
  * 2 Ernie the Envie square buttons
  * 2 Swap-bot 1-inch buttons – 1 of each style
  * 2 two-inch square Ernie stickers
  * 1 two-inch square Swap-bot sticker

Get cute Swap-bot stuff and support a good cause! Sweet! For more information about where your donation goes and how it is spent, read [my post on why I support the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society](http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=4123). 

&#8212;&#8211;

The fine print: _Your $10 donation covers all shipping costs &#8212; even internationally. Of course, we&#8217;d certainly welcome any additional donation you&#8217;d like to include to off set shipping costs. I will ship to the address listed on your Swap-bot account unless otherwise instructed. If your name or address used for the donation is different than what you have listed on your Swap-bot account, please include your Swap-bot username in the comments field. I feel most comfortable accepting the donations through our [fundraising page](http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis). That way you get an email receipt directly from the LLS that you can use for tax purposes. Your donation is fully tax deductible (in the US &#8211; I do not know about other countries). In addition to your email receipt, you will get an email from me confirming that your swag pack is on its way. Contact me at rachel -at- swap-bot.com with any questions or special requests._

**Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!**
