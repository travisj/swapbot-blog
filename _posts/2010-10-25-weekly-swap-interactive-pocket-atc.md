I am always looking for interesting ATC swap variations and this one caught my attention this week: [Interactive ATC II: Pocket Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76051) hosted by [starrgazer](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:starrgazer).

The [Interactive ATC II: Pocket Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76051) is international and open to anyone who has completed five mail swaps and has a 4.9 rating. For the swap, you make one interactive ATC that incorporates a pocket for your one partner. Directions from the swap description:

&#8220;This card will need to feature some sort of pocket. Intrepret the theme as you wish as long as there is a pocket, with something tucked inside of course. Get creative, think outside the box. Make a quality piece, something that you would enjoy recieving. Senders choice, so you may begin creating at anytime, but profiles can always be inspiring!&#8221;

Sign up for the [Interactive ATC II: Pocket Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/76051) before November 12th!!
