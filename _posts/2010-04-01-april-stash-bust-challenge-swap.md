In celebration of the , a few of us crafty internet peeps decided to pull together and do something to celebrate! Did you know that according to , in the US, we spend $4.2 billion per year on art supplies and many of them are toxic and harmful to the environment. Instead of buying new, let&#8217;s pledge to make April a craft destash month! Together, we can have a really big impact on the environment and on our own wallets.

For the entire month of the April, let&#8217;s pledge not to buy any new craft materials, tools, or supplies for the [**April Stash Bust**](http://dollarstorecrafts.com/2010/03/april-stash-bust/)!

Many of us have huge stashes of unused craft supplies with many fun and creative projects just waiting to be born. So, let&#8217;s also pledge to make at least one craft project from our stash using only what we have on hand. For motivation and to show how you can use and repurpose what you already have, there will be exciting destash tutorials and ideas all month long from these great craft sites:

  * And, of course, right here on the Swap-bot blog!

In addition to the great tutorials and eco-friendly link round-ups that you will find this month in conjunction with the April Stash Bust Challenge, there is also an**April Stash Bust craft supply swap
