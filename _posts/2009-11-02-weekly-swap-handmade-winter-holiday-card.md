For the swap, you create one holiday greeting card by hand, and send it blank with a coordinated envelope to your one partner. So, your blank handmade card and its blank envelope will be sent in another outer envelope&#8230; Your partner will then be able to use the greeting card during the holidays. (It is a little different from other holiday greeting card swaps in that you are sending your partner a blank card they can use instead of sending them a filled out card.) The sign up deadline is November 14th and you must send your card out before December first. The is USA-only&#8230; but I would love to see a similar swap created for international swappers, too!
