If you are looking for updated Swap-bot site info there are now a few places to find it! The [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php) page has been updated and lengthened, and we finally put together a more comprehensive [Terms of Use](http://www.swap-bot.com/terms.php) policy. The Terms of Use is fairly generic &#8211; we won&#8217;t share your info, you are responsible for your actions, etc &#8211; but you might want to take a look at it anyway. We have also created a new [ABOUT](http://www.swap-bot.com/about.php) page which contains a list of DOs and DON&#8217;Ts. I want to continue to add to those lists and I need your help! Please list any suggestions you have for Swap-bot DOs and DON&#8217;Ts in the comments. I can&#8217;t promise to use all of them, but together we can make sure we cover all the important stuff. Thanks!
