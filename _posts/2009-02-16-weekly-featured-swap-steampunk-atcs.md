Artist Trading Cards (ATCs) are still one of the most popular swap categories on Swap-bot, and there are always new themes popping up. This week we are featuring the [Steampunk ATCs swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/30817) hosted by [KatarinaNavane](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:KatarinaNavane). But, what is steampunk? 

&#8220;Think of what someone in the Victorian era would&#8217;ve thought the future would be like&#8211;airship filled skies, fantastic gagets running on steam and clockwork&#8230;. So a Steampunk ATC might have some Victorian elements, some more modern ones, some technological. Have fun with this. People define &#8220;steampunk&#8221; for themselves to a certain extent, so don&#8217;t get too nitpicky about it. Take the aesthetic and run with it!&#8221;
