Happy Friday! I hope you&#8217;re in the mood for some crafty summer links&#8230; because here they are!!

  * This [Cactus Pincushion DIY](http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2015/07/cactus-pincushion-diy.html) is extremely cute.
  * [Make cool Nautical Knot Bracelets with this Etsy How Tuesday Tutorial.](https://blog.etsy.com/en/2014/diy-nautical-knot-bracelets/)
  * In the mood for an adult summer treat? I&#8217;d love to try these [Blueberry Cabernet Cheesecake Cocktail Popsicles](http://www.endlesssimmer.com/2012/05/24/endless-poptails-blueberry-cabernet-cheesecake/). Yum! (These [Funfetti Cake Batter Popsicles](http://acozykitchen.com/funfetti-cake-batter-popsicles/) also look delish.)
  * And speaking of popsicles, these [Pool Noodle 3-D Postcard Party Invites](http://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1006707/how-to-make-popsicle-postcards) are a cool mail project in a fun summer theme!
  * I love this [mail art using transparent vellum envelopes](http://lostartrevived.blogspot.com/2014/05/lets-get-transparent-with-our-letter.html).
  * [Twenty-one Things Youâ€™d Be Surprised You Can Actually Mail.](http://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleporucznik/21-things-youd-be-surprised-you-can-actuall-mu8x?sub=3122584_2699591#.doQbBeL1q)
  * I haven&#8217;t actually tried it yet, but the [Shyp app](http://www.shyp.com) sounds quite handy for snail mailers like us. Shyp &#8220;picks up your items, packs, and sends them anywhere in the world using the lowest cost, most reliable option.&#8221;
  * Your S&#8217;more of the week: [S&#8217;mores Popcorn.](http://www.iwashyoudry.com/2013/07/08/smores-popcorn/)

Any other fun projects, pins, or promotions out there on the World Wide that I missed??
