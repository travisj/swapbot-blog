October is here and the Halloween themed crafts are out in full force! I know not everyone is keen on the spooky holiday, so I've still got a mix of crafty, mail-y, autumn-y links&#8230; Have fun!

  * These pinata-style [Trick-or-Treat cookies](http://www.notmartha.org/archives/2012/10/18/trick-or-treat-cookies-for-halloween/) from Not Martha are amazing!
  * And this [Haunted House Pop-Up Card](http://www.creativeinchicago.com/2013/09/pop-up-halloween-card.html) is genius! Check out the tutorial for instructions and a template.
  * New Swap-bot member, [jjhere](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:jjhere), wrote [this great blog post about the 'bot](http://elvesintheattic.blogspot.com/2013/09/swap-bot.html) and shared her incredible steampunk ATCs. Very nice!
  * Yum, yum, yum! These [Ultimate Caramel Apples](http://www.cookingclassy.com/2012/09/ultimate-caramel-apples-a-favorite-fall-treat/) would make the most delicious fall treat!
  * In fact, I am in an apple mood. Check out all of these delicious apple recipes: [Apple Rings with Cinnamon Cream](http://www.quickfoodrecipes.org/apple-rings-with-cinnamon-cream/) :: [Apple Cinnamon Roll Muffins](http://www.cookingclassy.com/2013/09/apple-cinnamon-roll-muffins/) :: [Apple Cider Muddy Buddies](http://whatscookinglove.com/2013/09/apple-cider-muddy-buddies/) :: [Apple Cider Sangria](http://www.inspiredbycharm.com/2013/09/apple-cider-sangria-lose-the-bottle-2500-contest.html) :: MMMmmmmmm&#8230;

  * I might have already posted this at some point&#8230; but I'm crazy about the cards and craft kits from [Yellow Owl Workshop](http://www.yellowowlworkshop.com). SO much color!
  * Did you know? October 9th is [World Post Day](http://www.upu.int/en/the-upu/world-post-day/about-wpd.html).
