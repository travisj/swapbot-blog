It is a great swap for matchbox lovers and beginners alike. I love February (my birthday is the 10th), so this is one of my favorite swaps of the year! 

We each will have just one partner in this international swap, for whom we will create a Valentine or February theme matchbox. We will also fill the matchbox with similarly-themed goodies. Most participants will probably choose to do a Valentine&#8217;s Day or Love theme, but some examples of additional February themes include Chinese New Year, President&#8217;s Day, MLK Jr Day, Black History Month, etc. This swap is sender&#8217;s choice and anything goes as long as you send a high quality matchbox that you would love to receive. The sign up deadline for the is February 3rd, and all packages must be sent by February 8th. You must have a 4.9 rating to participate, but new users are also welcome. (I angel my matchbox swaps, so consider this swap a no risk opportunity to swap with some new folks.) 

p.s. Swap-bot will be hosting a craft night event at on February 1st that will feature these matchbox Valentine&#8217;s&#8230; more details to come!
