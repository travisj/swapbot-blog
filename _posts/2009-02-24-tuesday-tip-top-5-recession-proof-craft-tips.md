The recession is hitting everyone hard these days and sometimes crafting and swapping is especially hard to fit into our budgets. But, wait a minute! There are some great ways that we can support our crafty habits even during a recession. Following are my top five tips for recession-proof crafting:

<li value="5">
  <b>Recycle and use what you already have and.</b> How many stacks and containers of supplies do you have in your craft area right now? Tons, right? Now is the time to start using your stockpiles creatively. After all, crafting is all about expressing your creativity &#8212; not buying the latest stuff at the craft store. Also, lots of everyday objects, and even things we consider to be trash, can be very helpful when crafting. Cereal boxes make great starting surfaces for postcards, Artist Trading Cards, or altered matchboxes. Old cd jewel cases can be made into <a href="http://www.24x7digital.com/content/view/91/77/">super-cute and handy calendars</a>. Plastic grocery bags can be made into all sorts of things by <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/crafting/crocheted-plastic/index.html">crocheting</a> or <a href="http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2007/08/plastic_bag_crafts.html">melting</a> them. <a href="http://www.craftbits.com/viewProject.do?projectID=155">CDs</a>, clothes pins, <a href="http://whipup.net/2009/01/12/tutorial-baby-socks-from-woollen-sweater/">old sweaters</a> , film canisters, <a href="http://tipnut.com/things-to-do-with-old-jeans/">denim</a>, <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/la/look/20-household-uses-for-newspaper-once-youve-finished-the-crossword-050121">newspaper</a>, and really anything else you can think of can be re-purposed into fun craft projects.
</li>
<li value="4">
  <b>Be patient before buying new craft supplies. </b> This is a no-brainer, but having patience really can pay off. If you must buy new things from you favorite local craft stores or online retailers, simply wait for them to put things on sale or run a promotion. This may mean buying holiday-themed items after the holiday or waiting for a special coupon to come in the mail. (Don&#8217;t we all love those 40% off <a href="http://www.michaels.com/art/online/home">Michael&#8217;s</a> coupons?!) Make a commitment to only buy sale items when/if you shop at (pricey) specialty craft stores and you will save a bundle.
</li>
<li value="3">
  <b>Shop dollar and discount stores.</b> Dollar stores and discount stores are an affordable place to find crafting supplies. Some sell craft-related things, but often you can find everyday items at discount stores that make great craft materials. Purchase clothing at thrift stores to use for fabric projects, or buy cheap children&#8217;s book to use in scrapbooking or collage. <a href="http://dollarstorecrafts.com/">Dollar Store Crafts</a> has tons of great craft ideas using inexpensive materials.
</li>
<li value="2">
  <b>Craft for a cause.</b> The recession is affecting everyone, but the poor are being hit especially hard. Take some time to create something special for someone in need and you will be sure to feel better about your own situation. For ideas check out <a href="http://handmadehelpsout.blogspot.com/search/label/Auction">Handmade Help</a> (a site dedicated to helping those affected by the Australian bush fires) and <a href="http://homespunhelpers.blogspot.com/">Homespun Helpers</a> (a group creating handmade items for multiple charities).
</li>
<li value="1">
  <b>Swap, Swap, Swap!</b> &#8211; In addition to being fun and entertaining, swapping can help replenish your craft supply stash by trading things you do not need for new-to-you supplies from other swappers. You can also continue to have fun swapping and meeting people from all over the world without spending any money by doing electronic swaps &#8211; swaps via email.
