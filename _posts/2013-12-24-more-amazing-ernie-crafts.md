I have a special Christmas Eve treat for you!! Check out these awesome Ernie creations made for the most recent [Ernie the Envie Give Thanks and Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/161102):

This exquisite napkin holder was made by by [moonlightlaura](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:moonlightlaura). I love the beautiful fall theme!

And this adorable, wintery ornament was painted by [FunnerKinberly](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:FunnerKimberley), the coordinator of the fabulous Ernie the Envie swap series. The next swap in the series, [Ernie the Envie Holiday Happiness](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/164524), has already closed and I can&#8217;t wait to see what the swappers create!
