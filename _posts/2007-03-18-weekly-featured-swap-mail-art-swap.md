[<img class="alignleft" src='http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/swap2.jpg' alt='swap2.jpg' />](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2582)I have a fun and unique featured swap for you this week (aren&#8217;t they all!). The [Mail Art Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2582), organized by [funkychickenoriginals](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2991), is all about being creative and making mail beautiful. Each member of the swap has five partners to whom they send one piece of mail art. Mail art can be anything from a handmade postcard to a decorated envelope, or even a lovely letter, zine, or newsletter. The swap homepage says this about mail art: 

> &#8220;Mail art is art which uses the postal system as a medium. The term &#8220;mail art&#8221; can refer to an individual message, the medium through which it is sent, and an art movement.&#8221;

The [Mail Art Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2582) is open for signup through March 28th. This would be a great swap for collage artists, computer designers, painters, or anyone who would like to send something fun through the mail. This swap could also be a great opportunity to challenge yourself and try a new type of craft or art style. New swappers are welcome, but please check all of the parameters on the swap homepage for more details. Happy swapping!
