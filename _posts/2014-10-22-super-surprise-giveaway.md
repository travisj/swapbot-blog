Hello, swappers! We haven&#8217;t hosted a giveaway here on the blog for quite a while&#8230; so let&#8217;s get one started!!

Travis, Crusher, and I have been doing some major cleaning and organizing to make room for the [arrival of our new Swap-bot team member in January](http://www.rljart.com/blog/2014/08/07/we-have-some-big-news/). While cleaning I&#8217;ve come across a TON of awesome craft supplies and goodies that I have either been saving for a giveaway or for some special project that never materialized. **I want to send these new & unused craft items to one lucky Swap-bot participant!**

I am still rounding up items for the giveaway box, so I can&#8217;t tell you exactly what will be included in the prize. However, this is not your usual batch of craft supply de-stash items! Everything will be in new, unused condition and will be in its original packaging where applicable. 

**Some of the types of items that will be included in the prize:**

  * Two full craft kits
  * Craft project book
  * Scrapbooking embellishments
  * Ribbon
  * Deco tape
  * Art and craft supplies
  * Decorative paper pad
  * Stickers
  * Notecards and envelopes
  * Plenty of Swap-bot postcards and swag!

Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230; it will definitely be a very RANDOM assortment of crafty items. But I know that one of our creative swappers will make much better use of these fun and funky supplies than I will. So, please enter to win them!!

**How to enter the giveaway:**

Comment on this blog post with your Swap-bot username and the answer to this question:

**What are your crafting and/or swapping plans for the remainder of 2014?**

You must be a member of Swap-bot to enter. The giveaway will be open for entry until Friday, October 31st. After that, I will randomly select and announce the winner on Monday, November 3rd. Good luck!
