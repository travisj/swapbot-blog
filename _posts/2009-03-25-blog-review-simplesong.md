I just discovered this beautiful little blog that I must share: [simplesong](http://simplesong.typepad.com/home/). It doesn&#8217;t really have much to do with crafts, but it does cover style and design&#8230; and it is just so lovely and simple! I love the collection of gorgeous images featured on the site by its author, Susan Song. Susan started her blog in [October of 2007](http://simplesong.typepad.com/home/2007/10/simplesong.html), and she also has a [letterpress store](http://simplesongdesign.com/contact.html) and is an [editor on kirtsy.com](http://www.kirtsy.com/editors-en.php). Tons of inspiration! </u>
