So, even though I have featured ATC swaps many times before, I couldn&#8217;t resist sharing this fun variation for this week&#8217;s swap: [](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/57130) . The swap is hosted by and it requires each participant to create two ATCs with an image of themselves. From the swap description: &#8220;You could embellish a picture of yourself, or draw a self-portrait, but try to be creative and make something to be proud of &#8211; it&#8217;s got your face on it!&#8221; You send one of your cards to each of your two partners in the swap, and you receive two cards in return from two different swappers. The sign up deadline is March 30th for this international swap, so go get !(Artist Trading cards are 2.5 x 3.5 inches in size &#8211; like other types of traditional trading cards.
