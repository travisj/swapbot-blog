From the swap description:

> &#8220;This is a bit of an unorthodox swap &#8211; for people who like to browse online and find gifts, and for those who need some gift inspiration. In this swap, each person will post some stats about 2 recipients for whom she needs gift ideas. You will look at your partner&#8217;s comment and come up with gift ideas for her&#8230;. Find online links to examples of at least 5 of your gift ideas for each recipient. Compile all this into an email, and send it to your partner!&#8221;

The swap requires a rating of 4.7, or higher, with no no-sends within the last three months. You must also have completed at least one previous swap in order to participate. IMPORTANT: This swap sign up closes on **November 20th** . That is this Thursday, so if you are interested you should [go sign up now](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/24924) ! Make sure to read the full swap description. Your gift ideas must be mailed by December 5th. 

We all need holiday gift ideas for our hard-to-buy-for friends and family. Why not let your fellow swappers help you out?!
