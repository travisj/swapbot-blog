It is holiday time! And that means we are once again hosting a donation drive to benefit [The Partnership for the Homeless](http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org/home.php5). 

You may remember our [hat and scarf drive in 2010](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/01/19/final-winter-donation-drive-update/), the [holiday gift drive in 2011](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2011/12/05/holiday-donation-drive-update/), and the [Hurricane Sandy relief drive last year](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2012/12/04/donation-drive-success/). The Swap-bot community has done a lot of good over the last few years&#8230; let&#8217;s keep it up! **This year, we will be collecting holiday gifts for NYC&#8217;s homeless children.**

**Did you know that more than 20,000 children live in New York City shelters?** The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services and support for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate our donation of unwrapped gifts and gift cards to be handed out to children at their **[Children&#8217;s Holiday Party on December 14th](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/news/entry/help-brighten-the-holidays-for-a-child-in-a-shelter/)**.

**Let’s put together a huge donation of gifts for The Partnership!!** 

We can accept the following items for donation: Gift cards in $10 or $20 amounts to stores like Target, Barnes and Noble, H&M, Gap, Old Navy, Forever 21, Aeropostale, and Best Buy. Gift cards must be new and unused and must be to stores that are accessible in NYC. Gift cards are the most requested item by The Partnership for the Homeless, but we can also accept unwrapped toys and winter gear (hats, gloves, scarves, etc) donations. [Read more info about what can be donated here.](http://partnershipforthehomeless.org/pages/sponsorship-opportunities/)

Send your donations by December 6th to:

**Rachel Johnson
  
Swap-bot.com
  
285 5th Ave PMB 415
  
Brooklyn, NY 11215**

And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: **Each Swap-bot member who sends in a donation of a gift card or item will earn the removal of one low (1 or 3) rating from their account!!** You must mail your donation to Swap-bot headquarters (address above) by **December 6th**. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will receive a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only have one rating removed during this donation drive – although you are welcome to donate more than one item! (All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings &#8212; it is not a &#8220;free pass&#8221; for flaking.)

**International option:** If you are unable to purchase appropriate gift cards in your area or ship other gifts, I am willing to accept cash donations via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com). I will then buy a gift card in your name to donate. Use the button below or send Paypal donations to rachel -at- swap-bot.com. (Replace the -at- and spaces with @.) All Paypal donations of $10 or more will count toward a rating removal.

**The Donation Drive is now closed. Thank you all for participating!**
