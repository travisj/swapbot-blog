I am so excited to tell you that we received more than 50 applications for the [Swap-bot Ambassador program](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2014/04/02/apply-to-be-a-swap-bot-ambassador/). Wow! I am so happy to see that there is a big interest in the program. The Swap-bot community is so lucky to have such enthusiastic and caring members! 

&#8230;BUT&#8230; 

Unfortunately, we cannot accept all of the applications at this time. (Mostly due to costs. boo.) So, I am doing the hard work of determining who will be in our first class of Ambassadors. I don&#8217;t want to rush the process, so check back for the **announcement of the Ambassador roster on Monday, June 9th**. I will be contacting all of the applicants by email before that time to let them know whether or not they have been accepted into the program. 

For anyone who is not accepted this round, or for those who may have missed the application process, don&#8217;t worry! We hope to continue to grow the Ambassador program. Hopefully, we will be able to accept new Ambassadors each year. Stay tuned!
