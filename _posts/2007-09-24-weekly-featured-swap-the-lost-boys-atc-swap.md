> Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It's fun to be a vampire.</p>
That is the tagline from the 1987 teen horror movie, [_The Lost Boys_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437/). It is about a group of young boys who bring down a wild vampire gang and it used to be one of my favorite movies (next to [_The Monster Squad_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093560/)) to watch around Halloween time. The movie starred Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, and a young Kiefer Sutherland. 

To commemorate this fun movie, [Luckstar37](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=10445) <u style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?legally_

The swap is pretty simple: mail one _Lost Boys_ inspired ATC to each of your two partners.

Watching _The Lost Boys_ while making corresponding ATCs&#8230; what a great way to get in the Halloween spirit!
