Oof. I am feeling under the weather and the poor Swap-bot blog is suffering as a result. boo. But never fear, I have brought you all of the cool links from last week in a special Tuesday edition link love! Perfect for the first day of [National Craft Month](http://www.crafttestdummies.com/craft-news/happy-national-craft-month/). Enjoy!

  * Learn how to make the decorative pom poms seen above using recycled t-shirts on [Craftoholics Annonymous](http://www.craftaholicsanonymous.net/2011/01/t-shirt-pom-poms-tutorial.html).
  * I have two incredible recipes for you today: [Homemade Cadbury Creme Eggs](http://www.instructables.com/id/Homemade-Cadbury-Creme-Eggs/) and [Oreo Stuffed Chocolate Chip Cookies](http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2011/02/oreo_stuffed_chocolate_chip_co.html). Yum! 
  * Have I already shared this blog?[100 Days of Snail Mail](http://100daysofsnailmail.wordpress.com/) &#8211; the author shares a piece of snail mail every single day.
  * [The Creative Place](http://thecreativeplace.blogspot.com/) has a bunch of free and very descriptive craft tutorials, including this [Button & String Mini Journal](http://thecreativeplace.blogspot.com/2010/02/ive-been-trying-to-decide-on-what-to.html).
