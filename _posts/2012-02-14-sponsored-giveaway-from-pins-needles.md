Last week I had

the opportunity to visit [Pins & Needles](http://www.pinsandneedlesnyc.com/), an adorable sewing and craft boutique in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. I was there for a [seminar on creative entrepreneurship](http://www.acedepartment.com/blog/2012/02/14/bank-on-your-bliss/) with [Nancy Soriano](http://nancysoriano.com/), but I was also excited to check out the crafty shop for the first time.

Pins & Needles is owned by Rachel Low (whom I met at the [Creative Connection conference](http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=4415) last year) and it caters to crafters who enjoy sewing, fabric crafts, and needlework. The shop stocks fabric and notions from around the world, plus patterns, needlepoint and embroidery supplies, stitching kits, ribbon and trim. Pins & Needles also offers [classes](http://www.pinsandneedlesnyc.com/classes/) for all ages and skill levels. 

I absolutely recommend visiting the charming store in-person, but if you are outside NYC, you can [shop online](http://www.etsy.com/shop/startstitching1045) or follow along with the [Pins & Needles blog](http://www.pinsandneedlesnyc.com/blog/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/StartStitching).

_And now a special Valentine&#8217;s Day treat just for you:_ Rachel from Pins & Needles was extremely generous and donated this beautiful stack of [Lotta Jansdotter](http://www.jansdotter.com/) fabric to **giveaway** right here on the blog! One lucky reader will win this stack of six fat quarters of fabric, plus a cute canvas carrying bag. (There will probably be a few Swap-bot goodies thrown in there as well.)

To enter the giveaway, **comment** on this blog post and answer the following question: **What fabric craft would you most like to complete?** (For me, the answer is definitely a quilt!) **Please include your name, email address, and Swap-bot username when you comment.** The giveaway will be open for entry until Friday, February 24th. The winner will be announced on Sunday, February 26th. Good luck!
