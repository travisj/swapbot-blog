Just a bit of self-promotion this week: I am hosting my annual [February Love Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/81100). It is a very easy craft swap &#8212; just make one decorated and filled matchbox in a Valentine or February theme to send to your one partner. The swap is international and open to excellent new users and anyone with over a 4.9 rating. Sign up before January 28th!
