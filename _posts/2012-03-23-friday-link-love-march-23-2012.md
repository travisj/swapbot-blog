Just a few fun links this week&#8230;

  * Make, mail, and receive a sweet spring matchbox &#8212; like the ones seen above &#8212; in my [Spring Matchbox Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/115882)!
  * For Easter or spring parties: [Confetti eggs!](http://ohhappyday.com/2011/04/diy-party-confetti-egg-game//)
  * These simple and pretty [flag place card printables from The Wedding Chicks](http://www.weddingchicks.com/2012/02/16/straw-flag-place-cards/) could be useful in many ways.
  * An online store that only sells artsy, temporary tattoos: [Tattly.](http://tattly.com/)
  * This [April Fool&#8217;s Day KFC &#8220;Fried Chicken&#8221; bucket](http://kitchenfunwithmy3sons.blogspot.com/2012/03/kfc-fried-chicken-bucket-and-sidesapril.html) (made entirely of dessert) is almost too real!
  * An easy fun dessert bar idea from Bakers Royale: [Banana Pops!](http://www.bakersroyale.com/fruit/banana-pops/)
  * You already know that Star Trek: The Next Generation is my favorite tv show&#8230; so you also know that I am in LOVE with this [crocheted ST:TNG crew](http://janafordknits.blogspot.com/2010/08/star-trek-next-generation_09.html)!
  * This [sneak peak of Katniss&#8217;s outfits](http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2012/03/scoring-katnisss-outfits-in-the-hunger-games.html) got me even more pumped about seeing _Hunger Games_ tonight! Are you going to see the movie? Team Gale or Peeta?

Have a fantastic weekend!!
