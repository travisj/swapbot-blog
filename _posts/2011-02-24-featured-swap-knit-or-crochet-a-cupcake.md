I&#8217;m a little late on letting you know about this swap, but this week I am featuring the [Knit or Crochet a Cupcake swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/84454) hosted by [cinderella730](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cinderella730). 

I love cupcakes and am always admiring the adorable crocheted cakes I&#8217;ve seen on the internet. I know that our Swap-bot members could whip up some cuties!

For this international swap, you knit or crochet one cupcake for your one partner. For inspiration, check out these online patterns:
