Quick announcement! I am going to be interviewed LIVE tomorrow for the [TerriO Radio Show](http://www.onlinewithterrio.com/) about [Swap-bot](http://www.swap-bot.com). TeriO is the spokeswoman for the Craft & Hobby Association and she hosts an online radio show called &#8220;Empowering Creativity&#8221; on [wsRadio.com](http://www.wsradio.com/internet-talk-radio.cfm/shows/Terri-O-Radio:-Empowering-Creativity.html). I am going to be on tomorrow&#8217;s show (Thursday, September 25th, 2008) which is broadcast live from 1-2 Pacific Coast Time (4-5 EST or 3-4 Central). If you are by the computer tomorrow afternoon, <a href=http://www.wsradio.com/internet-talk-radio.cfm/shows/Terri-O-Radio:-Empowering-Creativity.html">listen to the program here</a> . I will be interviewed during the final segment (last 15 minutes) of the program. It should be fun! (The show is also archived as a podcast for a year, so I will post a link to that later.)

UPDATE: You can download the MP3 of my exciting interview [here](http://www.wsradio.com/internet-talk-radio.cfm/shows/Terri-O-Radio:-Empowering-Creativity/archives/date/selected/09-25-2008.html). Swap-bot was featured in the fourth segment and the interview is only 6 minutes long. Check it out!
