Whimsy jars are clean, decorated jars filled with a variety of cute little odds and ends, like candy, small toys, coins, stickers, buttons, jewelry, atcs, brads, rubber stamps, beads, glitter, sequins, ribbons, charms, embellishments, chipboard, matchboxes, felties, leprechauns, papers, fabric squares, buttons, vintage images. You can see examples on Flickr [here](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%22whimsy%20jar%22) . 

For this week&#8217;s featured swap, the [St. Patrick&#8217;s Day Whimsy Jar Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/26374) hosted by [sylviasushi27](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sylviasushi27), you must send your one partner a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day-themed, medium-sized (at least 5 inches tall), whimsy jar filled with St. Patrick&#8217;s Day-themed goodies. You could include items with shamrocks, leprechauns, gold, rainbows, etc &#8211; anything that is related to St. Patrick&#8217;s Day!
