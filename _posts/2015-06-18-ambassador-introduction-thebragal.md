And I regret that I still have not introduced all of the awesome participants yet&#8230; but I will rectify that over the next few weeks with ten more intro blog posts. The Ambassadors are all enthusiastic, fun, active, positive members who are asked to help promote Swap-bot in their local communities. If you are interested in representing Swap-bot in your area and sending out Swap-bot swag, stay tuned for info about our upcoming second round of Ambassador applications._

**Meet our next Ambassador, [thebragal](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:thebragal)!** Thebragal lives near Toronto in Ontario, Canada. She is the mother of three boys and loves paper crafting.

**How thebragal found Swap-bot:** &#8220;I donâ€™t remember exactly where but I remember reading on a crafting blog that someone had made their creation for a swap and I was intrigued. I also saw Swap-Bot featured in a magazine.&#8221;

**Why she enjoys Swap-bot:** &#8220;Swap-Bot gives me exciting ideas that help me create. I have so many stamps and papers now that it can be overwhelming to focus and pick what to work on. Joining swaps stretches my creativity and helps me focus by giving me ideas of what to make. I&#8217;d never made a zine, matchbox ,or mixed media journal before Swap-Bot. A lot of the time I am way more excited by creating the project than I am about what I will receive. But when I get fun mail several times a week, it really makes my day. I am at home a lot as a SAHM and because of several disabilities I don&#8217;t get out much and can&#8217;t work. So, Swap-Bot gives me so much in just an envelope!&#8221;

&#8220;I also get a chance to meet amazing people from all over the world and have cultivated many friendships. It&#8217;s an opportunity to stretch myself as a leader and teacher when I host, creating innovative swaps using new techniques and ideas. I did a whole series on different techniques for my group, [Spoiled Swappers](http://www.swap-bot.com/group/0c1d0f543c1421ee85993396667d59d1/about). SS is just one of several groups I&#8217;ve been founder or officer for, contributing by hosting swaps, checking ratings and more. I am always eager to try new things and think up new ideas when hosting swaps with a goal of helping others think outside the box when they create. Swap-Bot gives me a place to do that!&#8221; 

**Her favorite type of swap:** &#8220;I love to make and swap greeting cards, matchboxes and tags and I have a fondness in my heart for Q&A email swaps. I can&#8217;t resist them! I hosted 100 Crafty Questions and drafted every question myself. I was super excited that it hit #1 in the Top Swaps!&#8221;

**Fun Fact about thebragal:** 

&#8220;When I started out by rubber stamping and making cards I PROMISED hubby I would never get into scrapbooking because there were way too many supplies to buy and those ladies were a bit crazy! This is back when my supplies would fit into a medium-sized box! I had no idea how much I could spend on stamps and card making or how many products are the same or cross-over. I now scrapbook and have most of a room plus an overflow storage room in the basement dedicated to crafting. Oops! Now I am 100%, and quite happily I might add, THAT crazy lady!&#8221;
