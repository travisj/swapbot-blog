You all know that Artist Trading Card swaps are popular, but this one has a bit of a twist. The [With One Palette: Harvest Colors](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6936) swap was created and coordinated by [linpengierhody](http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2617) (who, btw, has 104 hearts!). You have three partners in the swap, to whom you send one ATC each. &#8220;You will use ONLY Orange/Brown/Red/Yellow (although a little bit of white or black in addition to the 4 colors is acceptable if it&#8217;s part of a piece you are adding to the card).&#8221; The twist is that even though you will use harvest colors, the cards canNOT have a harvest theme. No Thanksgiving imagery!
