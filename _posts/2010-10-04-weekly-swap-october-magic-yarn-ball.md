This week, I am getting back to Swap-bot&#8217;s roots and featuring the [October Magic Yarn Ball Swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/74119). The very first featured swap here on the blog was a [Magic Yarn Ball Swap](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2007/01/21/weekly-featured-swap-magic-yarn-ball/), but recently I haven&#8217;t seen many similar swaps&#8230; until now! 

The October Magic Yarn Ball Swap is hosted by [cinderella730](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cinderella730) and it is international. Make sure to sign up before the deadline this Friday, October 9th!

So, what exactly is a magic yarn ball? Basically, you wrap cool, little treasures up in a ball of yarn, and give it as a gift. As the recipient crafts with the yarn the treasures fall out one by one, and they discover the fun as they knit or crochet. You can search [&#8220;magic yarn balls&#8221;](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=magic+yarn+ball&w=all&m=&s=&mt=&referer_searched=) on Flickr and view many examples.
