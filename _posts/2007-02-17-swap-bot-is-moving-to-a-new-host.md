Swap-bot is going to be down for a couple minutes tonight as I begin the process of moving to a new server. I&#8217;ll start the move late tonight, and the site will only be down for a few minutes as I move around a few files in preparation for the move. It shouldn&#8217;t be too noticeable and the long term gain will be a Swap-bot that doesn&#8217;t go down as frequently as it does now.

\*\*UPDATE\*\*: The move is under way. I&#8217;ve switched what I can, now just need to wait for our DNS records to update across the web. If you see anything strange going on at Swap-bot please let me know.
