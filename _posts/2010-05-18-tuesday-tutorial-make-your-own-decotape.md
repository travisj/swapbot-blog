DecoTape is decorative tape usually with very kawaii (cute) prints on it. It can be used to decorate things like stationery, art journals, and collages. DecoTape also makes a cute small gift. Although it is widely available in Japan, it is not in many other places. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve decided to make a tutorial on how to make DecoTape for all those kawaii fans out there.

**Supplies:** 

You are going to need some supplies to make this project. These are very basic and cheap items you can find at home.

  * regular paper (the kind that fits in the printer)
  * scotch photosafe magic tape
  * a computer or laptop
  * a printer
  * parchment or wax paper

**Tips:** 

  * The ink on the tape on the paper will be wet!
  * Use white or light-colored backgrounds when picking a pattern for your tape!

**How-to:** 

  1. Cover a sheet of regular printer paper with the Scotch tape. Make sure there are no gaps.
  2. Put the paper covered with tape in the printer so when it prints, the ink will be printed on the smooth side where the tape is.
  3. Search Google images or another search engine and find a pattern for your tape or create your own pattern with your designs!
  4. Open Microsoft Paint or another editing program and put the pattern in that program. You can get as creative as you want!
  5. Print it. Take caution with taking it out of the printer because it will be wet! 
  6. Use a strip of tape and put it over the wet ink, leaving extra tape so you can pull it off. Make sure the sticky side of the tape is on the ink.
  7. Pull off the tape and stick it on the parchment or wax paper. Later you can cut it out or do whatever else you want to do with it.
  8. Repeat steps 6-7 as many times as you want or until the ink dries out.

There are also many alternatives! For example, you could use a plastic sheet like a transparency instead of a sheet covered in tape! You can also use some packaging tape for a larger image!

**Uses:** 

There are many uses for Deco Tape! They make great goodies, can liven up stationery, and are a nice touch to art journals. You can use them as labels, too! You can create them, collect them, and trade them! Maybe one day, after reading this, someone might even do a hand-made DecoTape swap on !
