We are in the big leagues! Well, not exactly&#8230; 300,000 is a very large number, but it is still fun to see how Swap-bot compares to the most popular websites in the world. NMAP.org created a cool [interactive visualization](http://nmap.org/favicon/) using the favicons (the tiny icons seen in your web browser&#8217;s address bar) of the top 300,000 sites (with favicons) based on [Alexa traffic data](http://www.alexa.com/topsites). The size of the icon in the visualization is proportional to each site&#8217;s level of traffic. 

You can [search for Swap-bot.com](http://nmap.org/favicon/?q=Swap-bot.com) and find our icon in the lower right corner. It is tiny, but I am pumped that it is not the tiniest! Yay! I think it is awesome that we even made it into a group of top websites&#8230; even if it is an extremely large group! ha!
