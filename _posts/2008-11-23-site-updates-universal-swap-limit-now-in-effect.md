We have now implemented a universal twenty-swap limit on ALL Swap-bot swappers. You have NOT been dropped from any swaps &#8211; even if you are signed up for 100s. You simply cannot sign up for any new swaps until your current list is less than twenty swaps. This may seem quite sudden, but we felt it was necessary to move forward on the swap limit at this time. Remember to use your watchlist to keep track of swaps that fall outside the limit.

All new users start with a five-swap limit. Now, once they receive three &#8220;5&#8221; ratings, they are moved up to the twenty-swap limit. BUT, the watchlist is always completely UNLIMITED. (Previously the watchlist had a glitch and was being limited to five swaps for new users &#8211; we fixed that.)

This universal swap limit may seem harsh, but we have been discussing and receiving feedback on it for what seems like a long time. We believe it is necessary in order to protect good swappers from high levels of swap-lifting by dishonest people. In previous polls on the blog82% of respondents thought there should be some sort of limit<?a> and 

[64% of respondents thought that limit should be twenty swaps or less](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/10/20/swap-limit-poll/). Obviously not everyone participated in the blog polls and we are still totally open to feedback. However, our main objective is to prevent massive flaking and stealing. We have plans for a tiered system in the future.</p>

Remember to continue to come check out the Swap-bot blog. I have been posting a lot of important information as well as fun stuff like giveaways and crafty links. We do still have plans to start a Swap-bot Wiki, but for now this is the place for lots of good Swap-bot info! I think I will be announcing another great giveaway on Monday or Tuesday, so be sure to check back for that.

There is more info about recent site changes [here](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/22646) and [here](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/23112). Our changes can get really confusing, but I will always try to keep you as updated as possible. 

One more thing: For any adventurous beta testers out there, we have created a Swap-bot chat room! Yes, you read that right, a SWAP-BOT CHAT ROOM! woot! Travis has been working really hard on it. It is not quite ready for a full release, but we really need people to try it out. Everyone is welcome, but please keep in mind that there will definitely still be some bugs to work through&#8230; Also, it is a PUBLIC chat room, so be sure to watch yourself accordingly. Ok, if you are brave [GO HERE](http://www.swap-bot.com/chat) to start chatting! Thanks for your help!
