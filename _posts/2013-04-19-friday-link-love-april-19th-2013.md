It is quite difficult to stay focused on computer work today. The unfolding situations in Boston and Texas are on my mind and my heart is heavy. I can't seem to tear myself away from the news, but perhaps I should. A little light-hearted distraction might be helpful&#8230; 

Here are some of the crafty links I came across this week:

  * Check out these [amazing and absolutely beautiful cakes](http://www.mysweetandsaucy.com/2013/04/cakes-i-have-yet-to-share/).
  * [Pretty daffodil crafts.](http://blah-to-tada.blogspot.com/2013/04/daffodil-crafts.html)
  * Need craft supplies? I just discovered this new online store: [Save on Crafts.](http://www.save-on-crafts.com)
  * Doing some spring cleaning and need to GET RID of some craft supplies? [The Craft Dept has some ideas for donating supplies.](http://thecraftsdept.marthastewart.com/2013/04/spring-cleaning.html)

  * This is exciting! Swap-bot member [TangleCraft's](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:TangleCrafts) [Project Dissimulation is featured on CraftyPod](http://www.craftypod.com/2013/04/10/project-dissimulation-a-zine-about-birds-and-carrying-on/)!
  * I like this smart [DIY Rotating Goal List](http://cornflowerbluestudio.blogspot.com/2012/02/diy-rotating-goal-list.html) that uses Post-it notes.
  * Teacher Appreciation Week is coming up May 6-10th. I love this cute [S'more teacher gift idea](http://domesticatedlady.com/2010/smore-teacher-appreciation-idea-and-free-printable/).
  * Mother's Day is May 12th. Why not make this [cute MOM frame](http://www.favecrafts.com/Mothers-Day/Beautiful-Mom-Frame/ml/1) for your sweet mama?
  * Yum. [Buttered popcorn chocolate chip cookies.](http://joythebaker.com/2013/04/buttered-popcorn-chocolate-chip-cookies/)

Please be safe. Take care of yourself and your loved ones. 

**Spread love. Spread peace.**
