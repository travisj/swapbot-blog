My intention was to dedicate this week&#8217;s [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/) picks to my brother, [DrSwap](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:drswap), who is going to be the camp doctor at Boyscout camp next month&#8230; But when I started looking at camping-themed items on Etsy, I got distracted by all of the cute S&#8217;more stuff&#8230; I love S&#8217;mores! They may be my favorite food. And so, this week&#8217;s handmade marketplace features all S&#8217;more picks. Yum!

Who knew that so many awesome crafters were inspired by graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows!!
