**Swap-bot user, [kiwivandal](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:kiwivandal), needs your help!** She is teaching a Guerilla Art for Kids workshop at a Youth Town Meeting in her area in April. (The group that puts on Youth Town Meeting is called [The Youth Advisory Council of Caledonia & Southern Essex](http://www.facebook.com/groups/189732461074329/), in Vermont.) 

**Kiwivandal wants to collect examples of Artist Trading Cards and mini-zines to give to each of her workshop participants:**

_&#8220;I would love it if anyone could send a mini-zine or ATC (or both) geared toward 6th to 8th graders. Meaning appropriate themes, public awareness, inspirational. Anything really.</p> 

I am presenting the workshop to 2 groups of 25 kids (50 kids total), my hope is that my wonderful swap-bot community can reach out and help me collect enough zines and ATC&#8217;s so that I can give one to each kid to take with them. I have plenty that I have made as examples, but I think it would be so amazing for the kids to see them from other artists and from all over the world.

The conference is the first week of April, so I have 3 months to collect anything I can.&#8221;</i>

If you&#8217;d like to help, you can donate directly to Kiwivandal &#8212; her address and additional info is listed in this [forum thread](http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/85814/) &#8212; **or you can join the [special swap](http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/111293) she has set up for the donation drive.** For the swap, you send your ATC or zine to Kiwivandal and then send a photo of what you donated to your swap partner. Your partner will give you a nice rating for donating and you will earn yourself some **Swap-bot swag**! I am sending a big bunch of Swap-bot buttons, stickers, and postcards to Kiwivandal to mail out to everyone who participates in the swap. 

**Donate an ATC or zine to kids = get Swap-bot swag!**
