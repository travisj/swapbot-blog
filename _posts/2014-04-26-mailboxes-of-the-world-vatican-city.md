[Vatican City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City) is its own sovereign country walled off inside of Rome. It is the smallest country in the world and it is an absolute monarchy, with the Pope in charge! [Poste Vaticane](http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/it/servizi/poste-vaticane.html) has operated its own postal service and issued its own postage stamps since 1929. The Vatican mailboxes are very similar to Italy&#8217;s, but yellow instead of red. However, you cannot use Italian stamps in the Vatican, or vice versa.

The Vatican Post Office was my first stop after [touring the Vatican Museums and St Peter&#8217;s Basilica last week](http://www.rljart.com/blog/2014/04/23/vaticancity/). It is set up for tourists, with lots of postcards, souvenirs, and stamps to buy. I sent five postcards from the Vatican. Supposedly, the Vatican postal service is exceptionally reliable, so I hope they all arrive!!

I hear that stamps and mail from the Vatican is quite collectible. I wish I had sent myself a postcard!!
