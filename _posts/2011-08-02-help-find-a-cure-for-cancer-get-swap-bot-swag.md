You may remember that last year I [ran the NYC Marathon with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society&#8217;s Team in Training](http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=3570). As part of my commitment to the Team, I raised funds for cancer research and patient care&#8230; and the Swap-bot community helped out! Last year over [60 packs of Swap-bot swag](http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/07/13/support-good-cause-get-swap-bot-swag/) were mailed out as a thank yous for donations to the LLS.

The entire process of training and fundraising was so fun and rewarding that this year Travis is joining me! 

Just in case you don&#8217;t know, Travis ([travisj](http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj)) is my husband and the programming side of the Swap-bot team. He has never run a marathon before. We are both training for the [Marine Corps Marathon](http://www.marinemarathon.com/) in Washington DC on October 30th. We are really enjoying the training, so far, and we have set a joint **fundraising goal of $5000** &#8212; that is where you come in!!

Many Swap-bot members have requested a way to buy Swap-bot postcards, stickers, and buttons in the past. (We are STILL planning to construct an official store, but the process is slow-going.) BUT, now is your chance to get fun Swap-bot swag!!! You can “purchase” a special Swap-bot swag package by donating to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society via our [**TNT Fundraising page**](http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis). 

Get cute Swap-bot stuff and support a good cause! Sweet! For more information about where your donation goes and how it is spent, read [my post on why I support the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society](http://www.rljart.com/blog/?p=4123).

The fine print: _Your $10 donation covers all shipping costs &#8212; even internationally. Of course, we&#8217;d certainly welcome any additional donation you&#8217;d like to include to off set shipping costs. I will ship to the address listed on your Swap-bot account unless otherwise instructed. If your name or address used for the donation is different than what you have listed on your Swap-bot account, please include your Swap-bot username in the comments field. I feel most comfortable accepting the donations through our [fundraising page](http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/corps11/rachelandtravis). That way you get an email receipt directly from the LLS that you can use for tax purposes. Your donation is fully tax deductible (in the US &#8211; I do not know about other countries). In addition to your email receipt, you will get an email from me confirming that your swag pack is on its way. Contact me at rachel -at- swap-bot.com with any questions or special requests._

**Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!**
