I loved them so much that I did a private trade with her for 5 more.”</em> Those ATCs sound fabulous. Congrats on your win! (Spinjenny actually entered the drawing twice by , too. Thanks for spreading the word about the ‘bot!!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Linda50"><strong>Linda50</strong></a>: <em>“My favorite ATC is one that I received from my sister. She is the person that told me about Swap-bot and she knew it would be good for me. She was so right. Here is a to her ATC. ATC’s are so much fun to do and to receive. I am glad that ATC’s are something that everyone that wants to can do. You do not have to have a ton of supplies and they are not expensive to mail. Just about the perfect little mail art project. Looking thru my ATC album is almost like looking thru a family album. As I look at them I remember who made them and a little about the person as well.”</em></p>

<p><strong>AndreaSmondria</strong><em>&lt;/a&gt;: “my favorite atc that i made was for the i love the 80’s swap, it was of the flock of seagull hair style. it turned out great and i really didn’t want to part with it. But i did and my partner loved it also.”</em> &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Congratulations to the winners! Thank you to everyone for entering. Stay tuned because there will be more giveaways happening in the near future… (hint: have you seen the ? very cool.)</p>
