It is a great swap for matchbox lovers and beginners alike. I love February (my birthday is the 10th), so this is one of my favorite swaps of the year! 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We each will have just one partner in this international swap, for whom we will create a Valentine or February theme matchbox. We will also fill the matchbox with similarly-themed goodies. Most participants will probably choose to do a Valentine’s Day or Love theme, but some examples of additional February themes include Chinese New Year, President’s Day, MLK Jr Day, Black History Month, etc. This swap is sender’s choice and anything goes as long as you send a high quality matchbox that you would love to receive. The sign up deadline for the is February 3rd, and all packages must be sent by February 8th. You must have a 4.9 rating to participate, but new users are also welcome. (I angel my matchbox swaps, so consider this swap a no risk opportunity to swap with some new folks.)</p>

<p>p.s. Swap-bot will be hosting a craft night event at on February 1st that will feature these matchbox Valentine’s… more details to come!</p>

		<p>This week I am featuring a unique mail art swap, but you must sign up soon! The deadline for the is this Friday, January 1st! The swap is being hosted by and she explains the requirements very well in the swap description:</p>

<p><em>Take a piece of paper (the size and color is up to you) and on one side fill it with all the things you want to rid yourself of in the new year, like emotional distresses, love problems, self esteem issues, etc, or focus on one large issue. Scrible, draw, list, collage, paint, etc. Then on the other side, write many positive things you want to acomplish in the new year. You dont need to have either of these in paragraph form, you should just write whatever comes to mind, even if its only two or three large words and a bunch of doodles! When youve done this, fold the envelope up with the negative things you want to rid yourself of in the inside,where nobody can see it, and with the positive things facing outside . Inside this envelope you can put small things that relate to what you want to get rid of, like old bills, a picture of a past lover, a photo of someone who you cannot stand, or even small objects that relate, like maybe a small wooden heart, etc.. Then seal the envelope. On the outside, make sure to write your username, because your partner will not even open the envelope!! They will rate you, then burn it to ash after reading the positive things written on the outside!! This swap is for YOUR gain. The more you believe in the power of attraction, and the more you believe that you make your own destiny, the more likely this is to work for you! Think of it as mail art, but with a purpose!</em></p>

<p>You send your 2010 envelope to just one partner by the January 7th deadline. You must have a 4.9 rating, or higher, to join the . Happy New Year!</p>

<p>It is so awesome when Swap-bot users get together in real life. Recently six members from the met up in the UK for an afternoon tea. Here is a recap of the fun event written by Swap-bot user, :</p>

<p>_We had a lovely time at our British Birds Afternoon Tea Party in Bedford on Saturday, 5th December! There were six swap-botters plus six kiddies, and we each brought along some crafting bits – plus cakes and sandwiches, of course! At the start of the afternoon we each drew a name out of a hat and then set about crafting a “Secret Santa” gift for that person. There’s a photo of us</p>

<div style="opacity: 0; position: absolute; left:-3797px;">

<p>&lt;/i&gt; [seen above] <em>all on my flickr showing off our lovely gifts – from left to right the swap-botters are: , , , , (me!) and (who happens to be my mum!) We’re already planning the next meet!</em></p>

<p>It sounds like it was a great event! If anyone else plans a get-together with other Swap-botters, please let me know (rachel[at]swap-bot.com). I would love to feature the event here on the blog.</p>

		<p>Hey All,</p>

<p>I wanted to write a quick post explaining what happened here on the blog today. At some point during the day the company where we host our blog was hacked and all the customer passwords were stolen. The person who stole the passwords then logged in to many accounts and put files all over the place saying that the site was hacked. The problem still isn’t resolved and I am not getting very much information from our host, but if you would like to read more about the problem check out . I have pieced this blog back together the best I can tonight. The only thing that is really missing is the custom Swap-bot theme. Rachel and I will work on getting this back tomorrow.</p>

<p>I want to make sure that it is very clear that the site that was hacked was only the blog. Swap-bot, itself, is hosted on completely different servers in a completely different datacenter with a completely different company. The hacker that broke into the blog only had access to our blog posts, comments (which are all public already) and files. Personal data, such as your address and partners, was not compromised at all. This is very important and I want to make sure it is clear, so I will state it again. <strong>Your personal Swap-bot data was not compromised at all.</strong></p>

<p>Now that the blog is back, make sure to sign up for the latest giveaway!</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Travis</p>
