<p>We have a winner! This morning I printed out all of the names from the comments that had been posted on the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/10/24/winter-prize-giveaway-enter-to-win/">Winter Prize Giveaway</a> (we had a total of 85 unique entrants). Then, Travis covered his eyes and drew a random paper slip out of our Halloween candy bucket. AND… the winner of the Making Memories prize pack is <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:OniGiri885">Onigiri885</a></p>

<p>! Congrats! This is her comment from the entry post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lela (onigiri885) on 25 Oct 2008 at 8:54 am:</p>

  <p>I think it would be really cool if there was a ‘friend’ system, where you could add people as your friend and have easier ways of contacting them instead of just pm’s or profile messages. ^.^</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will be sending her an email confirming her win and then her package will be mailed next week. I hope she has fun with all those supplies! We are planning on creating a friends system in the near future (as well as a “block user” system), so it was a great suggestion, too. Actually, everyone had wonderful suggestions. Thank you all for your feedback! We hope to implement most of the ideas as quickly as possible. Although, knowing us it will probably take longer than we would like. Stay tuned for site improvements and many more giveaways on the blog! xoxo</p>

		<p>Happy Halloween, everyone! Have a great night and don’t eat too much candy – ok, eat lots of candy! I found a couple Halloween links and few random things for you to check out this week. Enjoy!</p>

<ul>
  <li>HALLOWEEN: Didn’t buy a pumpkin to carve this year? Try out this online <a href="http://www.cubpack81.com/images/carve_pumpkin.swf">pumpkin carving simulator!</a></li>
  <li>HALLOWEEN: I don’t know if these are truly used by kids or just funny, but here are <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/archive/candy_code/candy_code.html">Candy Codes used by kids on Halloween</a> &lt;/u&gt; to indicate what type of candy each house gives out.</li>
  <li>HALLOWEEN: <a href="http://bakingbites.com/2008/10/vampire-cookies/">A recipe for vampire cookies that leak “blood.”</a> Creepy!</li>
  <li>HALLOWEEN: <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/lollipop-cookies?lnc=6ce616f5f555b110VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD&amp;rsc=halloween+idea+of+the+day_recipe_b">Martha recipe for lollipop cookies</a>. They are so cute and seem quick and easy to make – last minute Halloween party idea!</li>
  <li>One of my favorite zines of all time, <a href="http://www.croqzine.com/index.html">CROQ Zine</a> , has a <a href="http://croqzine.com/blog/">blog</a> and I didn’t know about it until today! CROQ Zine &amp; the blog feature hip crafting and indie businesses.</li>
  <li>This next one should probably have its very own post, but I wanted to put it out there asap: <a href="http://www.booksforsoldiers.com/index.php">Book for Soldiers</a>. Since all of us swappers love sending packages, why not send one to a soldier serving our country overseas? Books for Soldiers organizes the process. You simply sign up and then they approve your application and send you the name and address of a soldier who requested the service. According to the site, soldiers sometimes have a lot of downtime and would love to receive books, cds, or dvds to pass the time and remind them of home. You can also send relief supplies (goodies and what not) and penpal letters (a thank you letter would be appreciated, I’m sure). What a great way to send a little love to our brave military men and women!</li>
</ul>

<p>Swap-bot was originally created to give bloggers a tool to help them host successful swaps with their users. Even though many swaps are hosted on Swap-bot every month, there are still lots of bloggers hosting independent swaps on their sites. How does a potential swapper find out about all of these independent swaps? Check out the <a href="http://swapdex.blogspot.com/">SwapDex</a>! The SwapDex is an index of current swaps going on all over the internet. (If you participate in any of the independent swaps and notice the hosts are overwhelmed with the organizational part of swapping, definitely spread the word about Swap-bot! We always want more dedicated swappers to join the ‘bot!) SwapDex is run by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:JennaZ">Jenna Z</a>, a friend of Swap-bot and a dedicated blogger. Check out her personal blog, <a href="http://corgipants.blogspot.com/">CorgiPants</a>, where she shares her everyday craftiness and cute photos of her pups. She also has a great index of <a href="http://corgipants.blogspot.com/2007/08/tutorials-index.html">Tutorials</a> and even some <a href="http://corgipants.blogspot.com/2008/10/bloggy-giveaway-carnival.html">giveaways</a>. Fun!</p>

<p>This week we are featuring a swap which could lead to a life-long friendship: the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/23699">“In Pursuit of the Perfect Pen Pal” swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:quietlyquirky">quietlyquirky</a> . If you are a lover of letters, or an avid writer who is looking for a penpal, this swap is for you! For the swap you will have five partners, to whom you will send each a letter describing what you are looking for in a penpal. The high number of partners provides a better chance of finding a great penpal match.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you love having pen pals, but have been frustrated with the frequency or quality of the letters you’ve received in the past? Or perhaps you really would like to establish a true postal friendship with someone you jive with, but you haven’t quite been able to find that special person yet. Or maybe you’d just like to have a loyal swap partner who shares your love of a certain craft. Well, here’s where I hope this swap will assist you in finding the “perfect” pen pal!</p>

  <p>Send each of your partners a letter; it can be typed or handwritten, whichever you prefer and use most often. Introduce yourself thoroughly, and then write about what you are looking for in a pen pal. The key here is to be clear and descriptive… For example: If you don’t want to be pen pals with someone who only writes once every 6 months, say that. If you’re looking for someone who loves to read and discuss books, say that.</p>

  <p>Some ideas of things to include in your letter:</p>

  <p>frequency – will you write once a week, once a month, etc.</p>

  <p>style – do you prefer handwritten letters, typed, or both</p>

  <p>swap – would you rather just exchange letters, or would you like to do an occasional swap</p>

  <p>beliefs – if you’d like to share beliefs/politics/etc. with your pal, or if those do not matter to you in a friend</p>

  <p>age – if you’d rather write to someone close to your own age, say so, or state an age range</p>

  <p>lifestyle – moms looking for other moms, dog lovers looking for other dog lovers, health nuts looking for other health nuts, etc.</p>

  <p>hobbies/crafts – if you’d like to have a pal who shares your love of a specific hobby or craft</p>

  <p>rather-nots – whatever you’d “rather not” have <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The swap is open to USA residents with a 4.5 rating, or higher. New users with a full profile are allowed. The swap is only open for sign up through October 31st, so act quickly if you would like to join. Your letters must be sent by November 21st, 2008. Make sure to read the full swap description before signing up. Happy swapping!</p>

<p><em>*\** We plan to feature a new, unique, public swap each week here on the Swap-bot blog. If you would like to have your swap featured, or have a suggestion for a weekly featured swap, please let me know at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. The swaps must have some sort of creative aspect (not just purchasing items), they must be public, and the coordinator must be in good standing on Swap-bot. The more unique and creative, the better! ***</em></p>

		<p>The forums are a great place to chat with friends, ask questions, and learn about Swap-bot, but in the past arguments and disruptive content have made the forums unpleasant for many users. We have now posted some new, straightforward Forum Rules for all of us to follow. They are very similar to rules enforced on other major internet discussion boards and forums. Swap-bot Admins (Rachel &amp; Travis) will be taking a stricter stance on the rules and a more active role in closing threads and restricting forum access for problem users. We stand by our commitment to free speech and non-censorship, while also working to provide a safe and fun discussion environment. A shorter version of the new rules is below, but please read the entire <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums_info.php">Forum Rules</a> page asap!</p>

<p><strong>Forum Rules of Conduct</strong></p>

<p>Violations of the following rules may result in a temporary or indefinite forum ban. Extreme violations may result in a partial or full account suspension. Forum bans and account suspensions can happen with or without warning and are at the discretion of Swap-bot Admins.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hate-speak and disruptive or hostile comments are not allowed.</li>
  <li>Threats of violence (against yourself or others) and personal attacks are not allowed.</li>
  <li>Using the forums as a way to Spam other members or advertise unrelated goods or services is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Posting another person’s address or contact information (including email address) is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Making repetitive or disruptive posts and repetitively “bumping” threads is not allowed.</li>
  <li>The use of false or duplicate accounts (also called “sock puppets”) in the Swap-bot Forums for the purpose of disruption or to avoid detection is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Posting copyrighted content without the permission of the copyright owner is not allowed. This includes posting private messages or email content without the author’s consent.</li>
  <li>Maliciously and/or falsely posting a user in the Questionable Swapper category is not allowed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Forum posts containing the following types of content may be closed by Swap-bot Admins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interpersonal disputes or arguments unrelated to Swap-bot</li>
  <li>Vulgar, obscene, or pornographic text or images</li>
  <li>Repetitive or hostile arguments</li>
  <li>Offensive or disruptive content that upsets other users</li>
  <li>Any type of comment making fun of Crusher, the Swap-bot mascot!</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite our best efforts to make these rules as specific as possible, there are still many gray areas. Our goal is NOT to be the etiquette or profanity police. Swap-bot is an adult site and therefore an appropriate level of adult content and language is fine. All enforcement and interpretation of the forum rules will be done by the Swap-bot Admins at their discretion.</p>

<p>The new rules are not retroactive. We are not going to sift through old posts looking for rule-breakers. Also, because these are new policies, we have removed the previous forum restrictions placed on users. Everyone gets a clean slate. However, new forum bans will be permanent, so do NOT break the rules.</p>

		<p>Originally we wanted Swap-bot to be as free as possible with members each being personally responsible for their behavior and swap reputation. However, lately we have been warming up to the idea of a swap limit for all swappers (not just new users). The tricky part is deciding how many active swaps each user should be limited to sign up for. Should the limit be based on a swapper’s experience (the number of swaps they have completed) and rating history? How many swaps do you think is a reasonable limit for established swappers? PLease answer this poll and add your comments. It would be most helpful to know how many swaps you believe is a fair limit.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

		<p>Weekly Featured Swaps are back!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/23485"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/swap.jpg" alt="" title="PAPER POSTCARD QUILT" width="200" height="158" /></a></p>

<p>This week we are featuring the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/23485">Paper Postcard Quilt swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:FloridaGirl">FloridaGirl</a> . This swap is international with two partners assigned to each swapper. The sign up deadline is October 31st, and you must send by November 21st, 2008. This allows plenty of time to create beautiful paper quilts for your partners.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea for this swap is for paper crafts as well as quilters to make a postcard quilt.You will make 2 postcards one for each of your partners. The postcards are:</p>

  <p>Size is 4″ x 6″.</p>

  <p>The foundation and patchwork have to be out of paper</p>

  <p>You may add embellishments such as ribbon, buttons, beads – but there are to be no stickers.</p>

  <p>Senders choice to give you more artistic freedom.</p>

  <p>Put the card together so it will stay together.</p>

  <p>Send each one in an envelope to be safe.</p>

  <p>Send only ones you are proud of.</p>

  <p>This swap is International and open to newbies that have completed 1 mail swap. No one with a rating less than 4.7 may participate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Happy swapping!</p>

<p><em>*\** We plan to feature a new, unique, public swap each week here on the Swap-bot blog. If you would like to have your swap featured, or have a suggestion for a weekly featured swap, please let me know at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. The swaps must have some sort of creative aspect (not just purchasing items), they must be public, and the coordinator must be in good standing on Swap-bot. The more unique and creative, the better! ***</em></p>
