<p><strong>Over 22,000 children are sleeping in New York City homeless shelters tonight.</strong></p>

<p>It is that time of year again when we can help brighten the holiday season for some of NYC’s homeless youth. Help us by donating to our <strong>10th Annual</strong> Holiday Gift Donation Drive to benefit <a href="http://partnershipforthehomeless.org">The Partnership for the Homeless</a>!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/redstripe2.gif" alt="stripes!" /></p>

<p>The Partnership for the Homeless is a NYC charity committed to building a just and equitable society and creating lasting community change through solution-oriented programs and policy initiatives that eliminate the root causes of homelessness. They provide all sorts of services, support, and advocacy for the homeless in NYC and they would greatly appreciate our donations. The money we collect will purchase toys, games, clothes, books and gift cards to be handed out to children at their Children’s Holiday Party in Brooklyn on Friday, December 13th, 2019.</p>

<p>Let’s put together a huge donation of gifts for The Partnership!!</p>

<p>Our donation drive will have a much shorter timeline this year. Your donation must be received by Friday, December 6th, 2019, so please consider donating as soon as possible. To streamline the process this year, online PayPal donations are the only option. We will use your Paypal donations to purchase gifts and gift cards for distribution at The Partnership for the Homeless Children’s Holiday Party on December 13th, OR to make a direct donation to The Partnership, depending on their greater need. Use the link below to donate OR send Paypal donations to rachel@swap-bot.com. All Paypal donations of $10 or more will count toward a rating removal.</p>

<p><strong>Click here to donate via <a href="https://www.paypal.me/swapbot">PayPal</a>.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/redstripe2.gif" alt="stripes!" /></p>

<p>And here is the extra-special holiday bonus reward for your donation: Each Swap-bot member who sends in a donation of a gift card or item will earn the removal of one low (1 or 3) rating from their account!! You must make your Paypal donation by Friday, December 6th. If you do not have a poor rating on your account, you will receive a credit for one future rating removal. Each person can only earn one rating removal credit during this donation drive –- although you are welcome to donate more than $10!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/redstripe2.gif" alt="stripes!" /></p>

<p>The Fine Print: All ratings removed in exchange for a donation must be at least six months old and/or the user must have exhausted all options for making up the swap. The rating removal credit is meant to remove unfair or unfixable ratings — it is not a “free pass” for flaking. Everyone who donates will receive an email from me with the details of the rating removal credit. You can reply to that message any time to “cash in” your credit. I also make a permanent admin note (only visible to admin) on each donor’s account stating that they have a rating removal credit.</p>

<p>As always, let me know if you have any questions.</p>

<p><strong>A message from The Partnership for the Homeless:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your generosity will bring smiles to the faces of 200 children! We thank you in advance for your support and look forward to your continued sponsorship as we put on our annual Holiday Party for these children and their families.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This year we are expecting even more children to attend the party. The day will be magical for these children with music, games, crafts, face painting, tasty food and even a picture with Santa! We hope that this will result in an abundance of laughter and fond memories.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is our goal to send each child home with toys, games, clothes and books, but more
importantly, a smile from ear to ear! These “gifts from Santa” are only possible through
donations, toy drives and the generous spirit of our contributors. As a non-profit, we depend on people like you, to help us make this a truly special afternoon.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope that once again, we can count on your participation in spreading holiday joy!”</p>

		<p>Do you love stickers? And snail mail?? Of course you do! And so do I. I have been collecting stickers since I was in grade school and can’t bear to part with much of my collection. It is a little crazy, but I know I am not the only one out there with a slight obsession with stickers.</p>

<p class="caption">This is how my very first Pipsticks subscription pack arrived in the mail, with real stamps! Fun!</p>

<p>Late last year, I discovered <a href="https://www.pipsticks.com/">Pipsticks</a> via Swap-bot user <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:luluvision">luluvision’s</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/8n-V37jttx/">Instagram</a>. In April, I couldn’t resist any longer and I subscribed to the monthly sticker mailing! Above you can see how my first Pipsticks mailing arrived. I love how the sticker packs are mailed with real stamps, and the vellum envelopes are so lovely. The packs are basically excellent mail art stuffed with stickers! Below you can see some of the contents of that first sticker pack I received. The stickers are all high quality from a wide range of manufacturers, including some I’ve never seen before. Of course, there are hits and misses when it comes to loving everything in these types of surprise subscription services, but so far, I really like and know I will use the majority of what I have received in my two Pipsticks mailings.</p>

</a></p>

<p class="caption">My first Pipsticks pack contained tons of stickers, plus a newsletter, quote card, and pre-stamped postcard.</p>

<p>Pipsticks was started in September of 2014 by Maureen, a mom of four living in California. The full Pipsticks operation is run by her and her husband in a small cottage on their property. They send stickers to thousands of subscribers in over 50 countries! Wow. You can read a lot more about the business in <a href="http://babyccinokids.com/blog/2016/06/13/5-questions-with-maureen-from-pipsticks/">this interview on Babyccino</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">The full contents of my second Pipsticks pack.</p>

<p>There are a couple different Pipsticks <a href="https://pipsticks.com/refer/Rache-HPUBCOBI">subscription options</a> for both kids and adults, but all of them come with lots of stickers and some extra paper goodies. The larger subscriptions come with a pre-stamped postcard that you can decorate with your stickers and pop in the mail – perfect for our postcard swaps!</p>

<p>If you follow my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/missthundercat/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://missthundercat.blogspot.com/">blog</a>, you probably have noticed that I am an avid fountain pen collector and use them regularly. <a href="https://missthundercat.blogspot.nl/2012/05/art-of-letter-writing.html">My love for these pens</a> started when I first learned how to write with them in elementary school. And I still write with them on a daily basis. I thought it would be fun to tell you all the basics of writing with fountain pens and give you a few tips if you wanted to start up writing with them too.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2016/nibshotpelikan.jpg" data-lightbox="http://blog.swap-bot.com/images/2016/nibshotpelikan.jpg" data-title="Pelikan M805 Vibrant blue">
	<img src="/images/2016/nibshotpelikan.jpg" data-pin-description="Pelikan M805 Vibrant blue // swap-bot.com" data-pin-url="http://blog.swap-bot.com/ambassadors/guest%20post/swapper%20report/2016/06/26/writing-with-fountain-pens.html" />
</a></p>

<p class="caption">Close up shot of the nib on my Pelikan M805 Vibrant blue.</p>

<p>With fountain pens it’s all about the nib! You have round nibs that have a round tipping and variates with a line width of extra fine to double broads and even oblique’s. And then you have stub or italic nibs which have a flat tip with which you can create lovely line variation in the down and cross strokes (usually these nibs are used for calligraphy). When starting off it’s advised to begin with a fine or medium round nib to see what suits your handwriting before starting off big like a triple broad nib.</p>

<p>For example, my handwriting has bigger rounded letters and I like writing with at least a medium, or even better, a broad or a stub. My husband has really small writing and often writes in small caps so he prefers using an extra fine nib to make his writing look legible. To help you on your way, Jetpens has a great <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/blog/guide-to-fountain-pen-nibs-choosing-a-fountain-pen-nib/pt/760">blog post</a> on choosing the right fountain pen nib. It’s a great resource and explains the various nib sizes, functions, and comparisons with brands worldwide.</p>

<p class="caption">Pen: Pelikan M250 with an older flexible nib. Ink: Akkerman Bezuidenwoud Groen, written on Tomoe River paper. A tip: when you want to write on blank paper, put a notebook with lined paper underneath as a guide sheet for straight writing.</p>

<p>In the blogpost, they also talk about pens that are <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/blog/great-beginner-fountain-pens-that-wont-break-the-bank/pt/862">beginner friendly</a> (and won’t break the bank). I started my writing with a Pelikan school pen and a Lamy Safari. Other fun beginner pens in my opinion are the Pilot Kaküno, the Kaweco Sport, and the Pilot Metropolitan. The Lamy Safari (and Al-star) also has easy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPyKDtpREt4">interchangeable nib</a> options, and they come in fun colors and styles.</p>

<p>What I like most about fountain pens is the fact that there is an <a href="https://missthundercat.blogspot.nl/2016/02/inky-goodness-life-of-inkophile.html">array of ink</a> available to use! Ink comes in cartridges, but you can also get a converter and fill from bottled ink. A number of companies, like <a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/ink-samples/c/21">Goulet pens</a>, <a href="http://www.andersonpens.com/ink-samples-s/1922.htm">Anderson pens</a> (US), <a href="http://www.purepens.co.uk/acatalog/Ink-Samples.html">Pure Pens</a> (UK) and <a href="https://www.appelboom.com/ink-and-refills/others-897/ink-lab">Apelboompennen</a> (NL), also sell vials with ink samples so you can try out some fun colors before you decide on getting a whole bottle.</p>

</a></p>

<p>In a future blog post I will talk about the various inks that are available, and how you can do a lot more than just write with them. But hopefully this will inspire you to pick up a fountain pen, ink it up, and start writing.</p>

<p>Once you get the feel of it, I hope you will join me in the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/224424">Fountain Pen pal: summer edition 2016 swap</a>. <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:BetsyPreston">BetsyPreston</a> hosted many of these swaps before and graciously gave me permission to host one this time around. The deadline to sign up is July 14th and you have to send your letter by July 31st. The theme is summer and you have to write at least 4 A5 pages (front) on the theme. It can be either your current summer vacation plans, your fave summer ever, memories of a fun summer you had as a child, or your thoughts on summer in general… feel free to be as creative with the theme as you can be. Just take your fountain pen, some fun stationery and write away!</p>

<p>A few months ago, I had the pleasure of meeting up with <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:missthundercat">MissThundercat</a> while I was traveling through Amsterdam. MissThundercat is our <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2015/12/07/ambassador-introduction-missthundercat/">Swap-bot Ambassador</a> to the Netherlands and she is a prolific artist and snail mailer. <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2010/06/17/swapper-meet-ups/">We met up once before in 2010</a> when she was visiting New York City. She is kind and creative, and I am happy to have her as an online and IRL friend. You can check out her mail art on her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/missthundercat/">Instagram</a> and her blog, <a href="https://missthundercat.blogspot.nl/">Contemplations of a Kitty</a>. And, follow her on <a href="https://twitter.com/MissThundercat">Twitter</a>!</p>

<p>I am excited to announce that you will soon be reading guest posts by MissThundercat here, on the Swap-bot blog. Look for her post on fountain pens later this month!</p>

<p>Hello Swappers! The Swap-bot blog is not dead! I promise.</p>

<p>The blog is hosted separately from the main Swap-bot site and was originally set up using Wordpress. We had been having quite a bit of trouble recently with the Wordpress platform, so we made the decision to transfer the blog to a more static and much more secure set up. But it is taking some effort to get it back into shape. We are working hard and hopefully it will be better and more user-friendly than ever, with lots of fun, crafty, swappy, snail-mail-y content.</p>

<p>Swap-bot was created and has been run for more than a decade by me (<a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">racheljohnson</a>) and my husband, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:travisj">Travis</a>. It is a big, every-single-day job just to keep the site up and running. But we love it. And we want to keep making it better and better. We have so many big ideas and so many improvements in the works! And we are working on ways to dedicate more of our time to the ‘bot, so hopefully you will be seeing changes a bit more frequently.</p>

<p>The community is what makes Swap-bot fun and creative. Thanks for sticking with us! As long as you all are swapping, we will keep working to improve the site for you.</p>

		<p>Thank you to everyone who participated in our <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2015/10/30/2015-holiday-gift-donation-drive/">2015 Holiday Gift Donation Drive</a> to benefit <a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org">The Partnership for the Homeless</a>! <strong>Together we raised $1,050 in cash and gift card donations and collected more than a dozen toy and gift items.</strong> All of the donations were distributed at the Children’s Holiday Party on December 12th, which served more than 250 local NYC kids.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.partnershipforthehomeless.org"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/childrensholidayparty15.jpg" alt="childrensholidayparty15" width="600" height="805" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17339" /></a></p>

<p>Arnold S. Cohen, President &amp; CEO of The Partnership for the Homeless, sent the following message of thanks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I want to thank you for your generous participation in the year’s Annual Children’s Holiday Party. Thanks to you, the party was a huge success with over 250 children and their families enjoying a day of fun at Genesis Home-Help USA, Brooklyn, NY where they enjoyed great food, crafts, games, and gifts. These photos of the party show the joy and excitement you helped create.</p>

  <p>It’s hard to imagine how precious a fun day is to these families. Many have spent months living in homeless shelters, with none of the familiarity and warmth of home. And others are on the brink of falling into homelessness. The Partnership’s staff at our Family Resource Center is working with these families to get them back into an apartment or working to prevent them from falling into homelessness. They also go beyond immediate needs to assist families in securing the best healthcare and education options for themselves and their children, financial counseling and job development.</p>

  <p>All of us at the Partnership thank you Swap-bot for helping our families experience the support of a community, especially as they face the many challenges in their lives. We look forward to partnering together again for next year’s party.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is great to hear that we helped make the party a success!! Thank you all for your donations and enthusiastic support each year. This is a very special community. Happy 2016!! xoxo</p>
