<p>From the website: “<a href="http://www.americancraftguide.com/index.html">American Craft Guide</a> is the complete resource for America’s professional handcrafters and artisans, independent artists, craft hobbyists, and those who love to buy American handcrafted goods. We bring all of these groups together to create a community that fosters learning, sharing, and promoting America’s handcrafters and artisans.”</p>

<p>I stumbled on this fairly new (started in July 2008) website today and was really impressed by the site’s clean layout and its goal of creating a comprehensive arts and craft resource. The site includes a collection of <a href="http://www.americancraftguide.com/projects.html">DIY tutorials</a>, a community section where you can chat with other crafters, an <a href="http://www.americancraftguide.com/events.html">arts and craft events calendar</a>, a <a href="http://www.americancraftguide.com/magazine.html">magazine</a> (I think that is their word for blog), and soon there will be a <a href="http://www.americancraftguide.com/directory.html">directory of handcrafters and indie artists</a>. It is still a new site and the community only has about 350 members, but it has the potential to be a great resource!</p>

		<p>This week’s featured swap is <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/26016">New Year’s Resolution Inchies</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:cmcedwards">cmcedwards</a>. Inchies are tiny (1 inch by 1 inch) artworks. They are a little like artist trading cards and they can be made out of fabric or paper. You can create your inchies using collage, painting, drawing, or any other medium or technique you enjoy! For more info about making inchies you could read this <a href="http://www.sewfunpatterns.com/inchies.html">website</a> , check out <a href="http://www.inchiearts.com/">Inchie Arts, LLC</a> , or view all of the lovely images from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/inchies/">inchies Flickr group</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/26016">New Year’s Resolution Inchies swap</a> calls for some creative art making: “Each person will have two partners. For each of those partners you will create four inchies. These inchies will express your resolutions and wishes for 2009. You may choose to write the resolution in words, use a picture, draw, create a symbol or any other way to express your resolutions in the 1″ x 1″ space.”</p>

<p>The sign up deadline for this international swap is December 14th, and you must have your inchies sent by December 20th. New users are welcome with a filled out profile. If you are interested in this creative swap, start thinking about and planning your inchies now so that you can complete them within the quick turn-around time! <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/26016">Click here to sign up!</a></p>

<p>Enter to win this great sponsored giveaway from <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">The Ultimate Handmade European Sample Box</a>. Bree from <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">geteurofied.com</a> is launching an all-European, bi-monthly sample box filled with amazing craft samples from independent artists and crafters from all over Europe on December 1st. A sample box is a great way to find out about up and coming indie artists and crafters. They contain full-size samples of handmade goodies made by small, independent businesses. Bree wanted to give Swap-bot users an early chance to win one of the grand opening Get Eurofied sample boxes. Fabulous!</p>

<p>I asked Bree a few questions about herself and <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">geteurofied.com</a> :</p>

<p><strong>How did you come up with the idea of The Ultimate European Handmade Sampler Box?</strong></p>

<p>I had participated in another sampler box for my own <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5563462">etsy shop</a> and had such a great time creating fun samples. I then purchased <a href="http://www.thespottedbox.com/">The Spotted Box</a> and realized all the sellers participating were based in the states. So I thought… let’s get the Europeans on the map! I am an American living in Denmark for the past two years and I am so inspired by all of the great designs here. Just while walking down the street to grab a cup of coffee I am inspired by the European culture. Then…the story begins.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get involved in independent arts and crafts?</strong></p>

<p>I have always been a creative soul. I remember coloring in my Rainbow Brite Coloring Book and designing outfits with my Tomy Fashion Plates. (uh-oh, did I just give away my age?) That then led me to becoming a Wardrobe Stylist after high school and the creative streak has never gone away. After 10 years of fashion, style and design, it is who I am. I also write a <a href="http://www.stylistdiva.com/">fashion blog</a> that’s filled with fab ETSY shops! I love to be able to dig into my craft stash, turn on some great music and let the party begin!</p>

<p><strong>How does the sampler box help independent artists and crafters?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">Get Eurofied</a> is a fantastic way for all of the skilled, independent Europeans to show off their online shops and share their talents with the world. The boxes are filled with handmade items that will show the buyer what kind of quality they will be getting while shopping at each of the participating stores. Once the buyer is enticed by the unique samples it is obvious that they will generate more business.</p>

<p><strong>What types of things will the Get Eurofied sample boxes contain?</strong></p>

<p>Some of the samples are earrings, fabric pouches, brooches, hairpins, necklaces, bookmarks, and MANY more fab surprises! (<a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/Participants.html">Go here</a> to see the current list of Get Eurofied participants.) When I say samples I really mean a “FULL SIZE ITEM – ready to use” for yourself or to give as a gift that you will be proud of giving. These boxes are over the top!</p>

<p>—————-</p>

<p>Would you like to win one of the Get Eurofied sample boxes? Simply answer the following question in the comments section of this post.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite type of item to purchase from independent artists or crafters?</strong></p>

<p>We will draw one lucky winner on Sunday, November 30th. Each person can only enter once. You must have a Swap-bot account in good standing (not suspended) with a valid mailing address to enter. You must include your Swap-bot username somewhere in your comment. (FYI: This prize will be mailed directly from Bree at geteurofied.com. I will provide her with the winner’s mailing info.) You must comment on, or before, Saturday, November 29th, to be entered in the drawing. If you have trouble commenting on the blog, you can send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. Good luck!</p>

<p>If you are not the big winner, don’t fret! You can get your own European Sample Box starting December 1st at <a href="http://www.geteurofied.com/">geteurofied.com</a>.</p>

The holiday season is upon us and it is a time for fun and for giving. Why not participate in a fun swap while also helping out others in need?

The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/25522">Season of Giving Swap</a> is open for sign up through December 10th, and you have a whole month to complete the swap. It is an international swap which welcomes new users.</p>

<p>Here are the rules of the swap from the description:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will make/buy something to donate to charity. This is any item you wish. This could be Warm gloves, Baby Blankets, Pet items for pet shelters, Toys for Tots items, anything you wish to make or buy to be donated.</li>
  <li>You will then take a picture of the item you are donating. Print a picture of the item you are donating. You do not have to print high quality images or even on photo paper, printer paper will work fine, just make sure you can see the image clearly.</li>
  <li>Donate the item.</li>
  <li>Write a note to your partner about what you gave to charity &amp; why you picked that particular charity.</li>
  <li>Send the note along with the picture of what you donated to your partner!</li>

		<p>We have now implemented a universal twenty-swap limit on ALL Swap-bot swappers. You have NOT been dropped from any swaps – even if you are signed up for 100s. You simply cannot sign up for any new swaps until your current list is less than twenty swaps. This may seem quite sudden, but we felt it was necessary to move forward on the swap limit at this time. Remember to use your watchlist to keep track of swaps that fall outside the limit.</p>

<p>All new users start with a five-swap limit. Now, once they receive three “5” ratings, they are moved up to the twenty-swap limit. BUT, the watchlist is always completely UNLIMITED. (Previously the watchlist had a glitch and was being limited to five swaps for new users – we fixed that.)</p>

<p>This universal swap limit may seem harsh, but we have been discussing and receiving feedback on it for what seems like a long time. We believe it is necessary in order to protect good swappers from high levels of swap-lifting by dishonest people. In previous polls on the blog82% of respondents thought there should be some sort of limit&lt;?a&gt; and</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/10/20/swap-limit-poll/">64% of respondents thought that limit should be twenty swaps or less</a>. Obviously not everyone participated in the blog polls and we are still totally open to feedback. However, our main objective is to prevent massive flaking and stealing. We have plans for a tiered system in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Remember to continue to come check out the Swap-bot blog. I have been posting a lot of important information as well as fun stuff like giveaways and crafty links. We do still have plans to start a Swap-bot Wiki, but for now this is the place for lots of good Swap-bot info! I think I will be announcing another great giveaway on Monday or Tuesday, so be sure to check back for that.</p>

<p>There is more info about recent site changes <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/22646">here</a> and <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/23112">here</a>. Our changes can get really confusing, but I will always try to keep you as updated as possible.</p>

<p>One more thing: For any adventurous beta testers out there, we have created a Swap-bot chat room! Yes, you read that right, a SWAP-BOT CHAT ROOM! woot! Travis has been working really hard on it. It is not quite ready for a full release, but we really need people to try it out. Everyone is welcome, but please keep in mind that there will definitely still be some bugs to work through… Also, it is a PUBLIC chat room, so be sure to watch yourself accordingly. Ok, if you are brave <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/chat">GO HERE</a> to start chatting! Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>xoxo</p>

<p>The winner of the <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2008/11/09/november-giveaway-enter-to-win/">November Giveaway for the Xyron sticker maker</a> is <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:HeideC">HeideC</a> ! Here is her comment from the entry post about her favorite thing to swap:</p>

<p>“My favorite swaps are one-on-one swaps. I love looking for items based on what someone has on their profile and finding or making just that special thing that</p>

<p>We did the drawing a little bit differently this month since there were so many participants. We basically took out any duplicate comments by the same person, added people who had emailed me, and then used a random number generator on the computer to pick the winner. Not exactly as fun as making Travis draw from a bucket, but still totally random. Cool. Thanks for playing! We have more drawings coming up soon.</p>
