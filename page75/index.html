<p>This week we are featuring a swap which could lead to a life-long friendship: the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/23699">“In Pursuit of the Perfect Pen Pal” swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:quietlyquirky">quietlyquirky</a> . If you are a lover of letters, or an avid writer who is looking for a penpal, this swap is for you! For the swap you will have five partners, to whom you will send each a letter describing what you are looking for in a penpal. The high number of partners provides a better chance of finding a great penpal match.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you love having pen pals, but have been frustrated with the frequency or quality of the letters you’ve received in the past? Or perhaps you really would like to establish a true postal friendship with someone you jive with, but you haven’t quite been able to find that special person yet. Or maybe you’d just like to have a loyal swap partner who shares your love of a certain craft. Well, here’s where I hope this swap will assist you in finding the “perfect” pen pal!</p>

  <p>Send each of your partners a letter; it can be typed or handwritten, whichever you prefer and use most often. Introduce yourself thoroughly, and then write about what you are looking for in a pen pal. The key here is to be clear and descriptive… For example: If you don’t want to be pen pals with someone who only writes once every 6 months, say that. If you’re looking for someone who loves to read and discuss books, say that.</p>

  <p>Some ideas of things to include in your letter:</p>

  <p>frequency – will you write once a week, once a month, etc.</p>

  <p>style – do you prefer handwritten letters, typed, or both</p>

  <p>swap – would you rather just exchange letters, or would you like to do an occasional swap</p>

  <p>beliefs – if you’d like to share beliefs/politics/etc. with your pal, or if those do not matter to you in a friend</p>

  <p>age – if you’d rather write to someone close to your own age, say so, or state an age range</p>

  <p>lifestyle – moms looking for other moms, dog lovers looking for other dog lovers, health nuts looking for other health nuts, etc.</p>

  <p>hobbies/crafts – if you’d like to have a pal who shares your love of a specific hobby or craft</p>

  <p>rather-nots – whatever you’d “rather not” have <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The swap is open to USA residents with a 4.5 rating, or higher. New users with a full profile are allowed. The swap is only open for sign up through October 31st, so act quickly if you would like to join. Your letters must be sent by November 21st, 2008. Make sure to read the full swap description before signing up. Happy swapping!</p>

<p><em>*\** We plan to feature a new, unique, public swap each week here on the Swap-bot blog. If you would like to have your swap featured, or have a suggestion for a weekly featured swap, please let me know at rachel [at] swap-bot.com.

		<p>The forums are a great place to chat with friends, ask questions, and learn about Swap-bot, but in the past arguments and disruptive content have made the forums unpleasant for many users. We have now posted some new, straightforward Forum Rules for all of us to follow. They are very similar to rules enforced on other major internet discussion boards and forums. Swap-bot Admins (Rachel &amp; Travis) will be taking a stricter stance on the rules and a more active role in closing threads and restricting forum access for problem users. We stand by our commitment to free speech and non-censorship, while also working to provide a safe and fun discussion environment. A shorter version of the new rules is below, but please read the entire <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums_info.php">Forum Rules</a> page asap!</p>

<p><strong>Forum Rules of Conduct</strong></p>

<p>Violations of the following rules may result in a temporary or indefinite forum ban. Extreme violations may result in a partial or full account suspension. Forum bans and account suspensions can happen with or without warning and are at the discretion of Swap-bot Admins.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hate-speak and disruptive or hostile comments are not allowed.</li>
  <li>Threats of violence (against yourself or others) and personal attacks are not allowed.</li>
  <li>Using the forums as a way to Spam other members or advertise unrelated goods or services is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Posting another person’s address or contact information (including email address) is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Making repetitive or disruptive posts and repetitively “bumping” threads is not allowed.</li>
  <li>The use of false or duplicate accounts (also called “sock puppets”) in the Swap-bot Forums for the purpose of disruption or to avoid detection is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Posting copyrighted content without the permission of the copyright owner is not allowed. This includes posting private messages or email content without the author’s consent.</li>
  <li>Maliciously and/or falsely posting a user in the Questionable Swapper category is not allowed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Forum posts containing the following types of content may be closed by Swap-bot Admins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interpersonal disputes or arguments unrelated to Swap-bot</li>
  <li>Vulgar, obscene, or pornographic text or images</li>
  <li>Repetitive or hostile arguments</li>
  <li>Offensive or disruptive content that upsets other users</li>
  <li>Any type of comment making fun of Crusher, the Swap-bot mascot!</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite our best efforts to make these rules as specific as possible, there are still many gray areas. Our goal is NOT to be the etiquette or profanity police. Swap-bot is an adult site and therefore an appropriate level of adult content and language is fine. All enforcement and interpretation of the forum rules will be done by the Swap-bot Admins at their discretion.</p>

<p>The new rules are not retroactive. We are not going to sift through old posts looking for rule-breakers. Also, because these are new policies, we have removed the previous forum restrictions placed on users. Everyone gets a clean slate. However, new forum bans will be permanent, so do NOT break the rules.</p>

		<p>Originally we wanted Swap-bot to be as free as possible with members each being personally responsible for their behavior and swap reputation. However, lately we have been warming up to the idea of a swap limit for all swappers (not just new users). The tricky part is deciding how many active swaps each user should be limited to sign up for. Should the limit be based on a swapper’s experience (the number of swaps they have completed) and rating history? How many swaps do you think is a reasonable limit for established swappers? PLease answer this poll and add your comments. It would be most helpful to know how many swaps you believe is a fair limit.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/23485"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/swap.jpg" alt="" title="PAPER POSTCARD QUILT" width="200" height="158" /></a></p>

This allows plenty of time to create beautiful paper quilts for your partners.</p>

<p>From the swap description:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Size is 4″ x 6″.</p>

  <p>The foundation and patchwork have to be out of paper</p>

  <p>You may add embellishments such as ribbon, buttons, beads – but there are to be no stickers.</p>

  <p>Senders choice to give you more artistic freedom.</p>

  <p>Put the card together so it will stay together.</p>

  <p>Send each one in an envelope to be safe.</p>

  <p>Send only ones you are proud of.</p>

  <p>This swap is International and open to newbies that have completed 1 mail swap. No one with a rating less than 4.7 may participate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Happy swapping!</p>

		<p>Two new and fairly major updates today:</p>

<p>(1) <strong>Rating limit on partially suspended users</strong> – Partially suspended users can no longer leave negative ratings. While suspended, the only rating option available for them to give their partners in their swaps is the “5” rating. We have had some trouble with suspended users leaving retaliatory and unfair ratings for their partners. This change prevents that from happening. However, if/when a user makes up their poor ratings and becomes un-suspended, all of the rating options become available once again. It is still up to each individual to determine whether to send to a suspended member based on whether you believe they will fix their poor ratings and become a good swapper again. It is a tricky situation, but this change will at least stop good swappers from being “hurt” by questionable swappers.</p>

<p>(2) <strong>Swaps now closed after six months</strong> – All swaps will now be “closed” six months after their send date. At this time the swap will no longer be editable by the coordinator and participants will no longer be able to view their partners’ address info or rate their partners. This change prevents users’ addresses from being on view indefinitely to their previous swap partners. It also ensures that swappers can put old swaps “behind them” and no longer have to worry about things like if they are going to get a bad rating from a partner they sent to but never heard from.</p>

<p>This is what the swap option box will look like in a closed swap:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-1.png"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-1.png" alt="" title="picture-1" width="456" height="182" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-206" /></a></p>

<p>This change works with our automatic account suspension system (see previous update info <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2007/11/24/automatic-account-suspensions/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2007/12/02/site-updates/">here</a>) to provide a statute of limitations on poor swap performance. Six months after a swap, a swapper can no longer receive a new rating in order to remove a “1” from their account, but their “1” ratings are no longer used as a determining factor in the automatic account suspension at that time. Basically, once a swap is six months old it is closed and your rating (or non-rating) is set in stone. Of course, since this is a new (and abrupt) change, we can work with any coordinators who need any assistance or wiggle room.</p>

<p><strong>A few words about partial and full suspensions:</strong> The computer handles all partial suspension that are based on users having four, or more, “1” ratings. Those suspension happen automatically, so it is important that we all rate honestly and promptly so that the computer can do its job effectively. Swap-bot Admins also partially suspend users for questionable performance or for being underage. Full suspension is only used for a small number of reasons (fraudulent or dangerous behavior, using an account to spam other users, invalid or questionable address, duplicate accounts, or offensive or hurtful behavior). Now that users are able to delete their accounts, full suspension only indicates a breach of our rules or policies. Having a certain number of “1” ratings does not necessarily mean that a user will be fully suspended. We rely heavily on our coordinators to determine who they allow in their swaps. Even if a swapper who has recevied a bunch of “1”s becomes unsuspended after six months, that does NOT mean that coordinators need to (or should) let them in swaps. Coordinators own their swaps. We are not able to reassign partners or remove participants after a coordinator has assigned partners. Please keep this is mind when choosing what swaps to join. A coordinator’s record and the swap’s wording can tell you a lot about how successful a swap is going to be. Also keep in mind that a low level of flaking is a risk we all take when swapping with others over the internet. Yep. Ok.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 10/26/08:</strong> We have made some revisions to the site changes released last weekend. In response to user comments we have made the following adjustments:</p>

<p><strong>Swap Closure:</strong> Swaps will still be closed six months after the mail deadline, but we have changed what it means to be closed. A closed swap can no longer be edited by the coordinator, and all participant address info is removed from view. However, you can still leave or change ratings. Ratings will always be able to be improved and you will always be able to view the Swap-bot username (and click to go to their profile page) of your previous partners.</p>

<p><strong>Rating changes:</strong> Positive ratings now “lock in” after a two-week revision period. Two weeks after rating your partner you can no longer lower a rating. You can only give higher ratings after the two weeks. For example, if you give your partner a 5, you then have two weeks to change that rating if it was a mistake. After two weeks, the 5 is permanent. If you give your partner a 3, you then have two weeks to lower it to a 1 if needed, but you can raise it to a five at any time. If you give a 1 rating it can be changed to a higher rating at any time. However, you must be very careful when revising ratings to a higher level because they will immediately “lock in” if it has been longer than two weeks after you left their very first rating. The “I do not wish to rate at this time” option becomes unavailable two weeks after giving any numbered rating. Comments and hearts will always be revisable or removable, but changing either will NOT affect a rating’s time stamp and will NOT cause the rating to jump to the top of a person’s rating list.</p>

<p>This rating change requires that we are all more careful and deliberate about our ratings. Make sure that you are rating the correct person in each swap. Also, remember to always include the swap name and your username in each swap package so that you partners can easily rate you.</p>

<p>Travis will be releasing these new changes tonight. Important: All current ratings have been given the two week revision time period. If you believe you have rated anyone a 5 mistakenly, now is the time to revise it. Remember, all low rating can be revised to a higher rating at any time – only 5 ratings become totally permanent after the two-week period.</p>

<p>This rating change is confusing, but it should not affect most of us very often. It basically only prevents users from changing positive ratings in a revengeful manner. It ensures that we never have to worry about losing any of the positive ratings that we have earned.</p>

		<p>Hi swappers! Yesterday and today were my first two days as a “real” Swap-bot employee! I have cut back on my graphic design job in order to devote more time to managing and improving Swap-bot. I am very excited to be making this change, but also a bit nervous because of how shaky the economy is right now… Anyway, I just wanted to give everyone a head’s up on my admin activities. Right now I am still trying to catch up on all of the support emails and personal messages. I think I have made some good progress, but there may be some past emails and messages that I may never get to. I don’t want to declare email bankruptcy, but I may need to cut my losses at some point. If you wrote to me regarding a problem within the last two months and you never heard form me, I suggest sending me another email. You know, just in case… Contact me at questions [at] swap-bot.com. I have been answering emails constantly for the past two months, but they sometimes got out of my control… Hopefully I can keep things in check from now on!</p>

<p>OK, back to work! xoxo<em style="display:none"><a href="http://londongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/?domino">Domino move</a></em></p>
