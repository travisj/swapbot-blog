		<p>Two new and fairly major updates today:</p>

<p>(1) <strong>Rating limit on partially suspended users</strong> – Partially suspended users can no longer leave negative ratings. While suspended, the only rating option available for them to give their partners in their swaps is the “5” rating. We have had some trouble with suspended users leaving retaliatory and unfair ratings for their partners. This change prevents that from happening. However, if/when a user makes up their poor ratings and becomes un-suspended, all of the rating options become available once again. It is still up to each individual to determine whether to send to a suspended member based on whether you believe they will fix their poor ratings and become a good swapper again. It is a tricky situation, but this change will at least stop good swappers from being “hurt” by questionable swappers.</p>

<p>(2) <strong>Swaps now closed after six months</strong> – All swaps will now be “closed” six months after their send date. At this time the swap will no longer be editable by the coordinator and participants will no longer be able to view their partners’ address info or rate their partners. This change prevents users’ addresses from being on view indefinitely to their previous swap partners. It also ensures that swappers can put old swaps “behind them” and no longer have to worry about things like if they are going to get a bad rating from a partner they sent to but never heard from.</p>

<p>This is what the swap option box will look like in a closed swap:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-1.png"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-1.png" alt="" title="picture-1" width="456" height="182" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-206" /></a></p>

<p>This change works with our automatic account suspension system (see previous update info <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2007/11/24/automatic-account-suspensions/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2007/12/02/site-updates/">here</a>) to provide a statute of limitations on poor swap performance. Six months after a swap, a swapper can no longer receive a new rating in order to remove a “1” from their account, but their “1” ratings are no longer used as a determining factor in the automatic account suspension at that time. Basically, once a swap is six months old it is closed and your rating (or non-rating) is set in stone. Of course, since this is a new (and abrupt) change, we can work with any coordinators who need any assistance or wiggle room.</p>

<p><strong>A few words about partial and full suspensions:</strong> The computer handles all partial suspension that are based on users having four, or more, “1” ratings. Those suspension happen automatically, so it is important that we all rate honestly and promptly so that the computer can do its job effectively. Swap-bot Admins also partially suspend users for questionable performance or for being underage. Full suspension is only used for a small number of reasons (fraudulent or dangerous behavior, using an account to spam other users, invalid or questionable address, duplicate accounts, or offensive or hurtful behavior). Now that users are able to delete their accounts, full suspension only indicates a breach of our rules or policies. Having a certain number of “1” ratings does not necessarily mean that a user will be fully suspended. We rely heavily on our coordinators to determine who they allow in their swaps. Even if a swapper who has recevied a bunch of “1”s becomes unsuspended after six months, that does NOT mean that coordinators need to (or should) let them in swaps. Coordinators own their swaps. We are not able to reassign partners or remove participants after a coordinator has assigned partners. Please keep this is mind when choosing what swaps to join. A coordinator’s record and the swap’s wording can tell you a lot about how successful a swap is going to be. Also keep in mind that a low level of flaking is a risk we all take when swapping with others over the internet. Yep. Ok.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 10/26/08:</strong> We have made some revisions to the site changes released last weekend. In response to user comments we have made the following adjustments:</p>

<p><strong>Swap Closure:</strong> Swaps will still be closed six months after the mail deadline, but we have changed what it means to be closed. A closed swap can no longer be edited by the coordinator, and all participant address info is removed from view. However, you can still leave or change ratings. Ratings will always be able to be improved and you will always be able to view the Swap-bot username (and click to go to their profile page) of your previous partners.</p>

<p><strong>Rating changes:</strong> Positive ratings now “lock in” after a two-week revision period. Two weeks after rating your partner you can no longer lower a rating. You can only give higher ratings after the two weeks. For example, if you give your partner a 5, you then have two weeks to change that rating if it was a mistake. After two weeks, the 5 is permanent. If you give your partner a 3, you then have two weeks to lower it to a 1 if needed, but you can raise it to a five at any time. If you give a 1 rating it can be changed to a higher rating at any time. However, you must be very careful when revising ratings to a higher level because they will immediately “lock in” if it has been longer than two weeks after you left their very first rating. The “I do not wish to rate at this time” option becomes unavailable two weeks after giving any numbered rating. Comments and hearts will always be revisable or removable, but changing either will NOT affect a rating’s time stamp and will NOT cause the rating to jump to the top of a person’s rating list.</p>

<p>This rating change requires that we are all more careful and deliberate about our ratings. Make sure that you are rating the correct person in each swap. Also, remember to always include the swap name and your username in each swap package so that you partners can easily rate you.</p>

<p>Travis will be releasing these new changes tonight. Important: All current ratings have been given the two week revision time period. If you believe you have rated anyone a 5 mistakenly, now is the time to revise it. Remember, all low rating can be revised to a higher rating at any time – only 5 ratings become totally permanent after the two-week period.</p>

<p>This rating change is confusing, but it should not affect most of us very often. It basically only prevents users from changing positive ratings in a revengeful manner. It ensures that we never have to worry about losing any of the positive ratings that we have earned.</p>

		<p>Hi swappers! Yesterday and today were my first two days as a “real” Swap-bot employee! I have cut back on my graphic design job in order to devote more time to managing and improving Swap-bot. I am very excited to be making this change, but also a bit nervous because of how shaky the economy is right now… Anyway, I just wanted to give everyone a head’s up on my admin activities. Right now I am still trying to catch up on all of the support emails and personal messages. I think I have made some good progress, but there may be some past emails and messages that I may never get to. I don’t want to declare email bankruptcy, but I may need to cut my losses at some point. If you wrote to me regarding a problem within the last two months and you never heard form me, I suggest sending me another email. You know, just in case… Contact me at questions [at] swap-bot.com. I have been answering emails constantly for the past two months, but they sometimes got out of my control… Hopefully I can keep things in check from now on!</p>

<p>OK, back to work! xoxo<em style="display:none"><a href="http://londongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/?domino">Domino move</a></em></p>

		<p>Associated press reporter, Holly Ramer, interviewed me a few weeks ago for an article about internet swapping. Her article has now been released online on MSNBC and other news outlets. Read it <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26609635/">here</a>. Thanks for the coverage, Holly! We love press!</p>

<p>The swap-bot section of the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At Swap-bot.com, a site devoted exclusively to swaps, the most popular ones tend to involve artist trading cards — small works of art that let participants share their artistic styles with others. At any given time, the site features 500 active swaps, and it has hosted more than 20,000 since 2005.</p>

  <p>Swap-bot uses a computer algorithm to mix up participants and assign partners, sends out reminder e-mails to participants, and includes a feedback system to deter “flakers” or cheaters who don’t send their packages.</p>

  <p>But why go through the trouble of making something for someone you don’t know?</p>

  <p>“I think the number one thing is that the lure of getting a package in the mail is pretty strong,” says Rachel Johnson, 27, of Eugene, Ore., who founded the site with her husband. “But I like to think it’s also a way of connecting physically with someone you only know as a screen name. People are meeting and connecting with people from different countries and different cultures.”</p>

		<p>Due to the most recent of many arguing matches in the Swap-bot Forums, many users have questioned our policies of non-censorship and requested that we work toward a more pleasant atmosphere on Swap-bot. There are a few avenues that we can explore in order to make Swap-bot “nicer.” I need your help in determining which new policies we should adopt. Please complete the following polls and leave any comments. Our main objective is to provide a quality website and helpful service to our users. Your opinions are very important!</p>

		<p>A few baby step-type site changes to tell you about…</p>

<p>The details: Founders can now make officers and members co-founders. Any founder can demote or remove another founder, but you cannot demote or remove yourself from a founder position. Also, group swaps should now still stay on the group homepage through the sign up deadline instead of being removed the day before. Finally, the list of users on the Manage Group Members page is flowing into three columns now instead of just one. That last one is a small change, but it makes viewing members a little easier.</p>

<p>BIG CHANGE: We have made a reversal of policy and now allow members to delete their own accounts. Threats of legal action led to this change. Now, when a user deletes their account ALL info (except username and past comments made throughout the site) is removed from our system completely. Deleted accounts absolutely canNOT be retrieved. However a special “address token” is created and kept in our database which prevents users from creating new accounts with the same address. So, only delete your account if you are completely sure. Fraudulent and rule breaking accounts will still be fully suspended, not deleted.</p>

		<p>We all know about the online auction giant <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>, and almost everyone is loving <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> for buying and selling handmade goods online, but what if you want an alternative option for finding cool, independent artists and crafters or selling your own crafts? I have discovered three more websites where you can buy or sell handmade items: <a href="http://www.lov.li./">Lov.li</a>, <a href="http://en.dawanda.com/">DaWanda</a>, and <a href="http://www.madeit.com.au/">Made It</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lov.li./"><img src="http://www.rljart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/lovli.jpg" alt="" title="lovli" width="450" height="408" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1474" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Lov.li</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.lov.li./">Lov.li</a> is a community of people who love art, crafts and handmade products. On the site you can buy cool stuff, share your art, sell your products, create groups, promote events, share video, and of course, make friends. People from all over the world use the site to sell their handmade crafts and to interact with other artists and crafters. You can create your own blog on the site and join groups based around specific crafting interests. Jewelry and accessories seem to be the most popular items being sold on Lov.li, but there is a wide variety of items to explore. Although the site seems somewhat simple, there are many interesting ways to search for products, including by maker, tag, and by those being made closest to your own location.</p>

Independent artists and craft people sell truly awesome fashions, home products, and supplies on the site. The products being sold on DaWands seem to have an especially high level of quality and uniqueness and the site seems clear and easy to navigate. The site also includes discussion forums in all three languages that anyone can participate in, even if you are not selling or buying.</p>

<p><strong>Made It: buy, sell, and talk independent</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.madeit.com.au/">Made It</a> is an Australian shop and directory of independent designers. Selling is restricted to Australian residents, but buyers from overseas are welcomed. Everything from stationery to bath and body products to clothing is sold on Made It. Made It also has discussion forums, but the highlight of the site is the comprehensive <a href="http://www.madeit.com.au/directory/directory.html">independent Australian designer directory</a> which profiles hundreds of indie businesses.</p>

Sign up for the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/18782">Friends of purplepinkandorange.com postcard swap</a>! The swap is international and everyone is welcome.

		<p>In addition to trying to correct some of the glitches caused by moving to the new server, we also created some new ways to view ratings and made some Swap-bot graphics available today.</p>

<p><strong>Ratings</strong></p>

<p>There is now more info in the upper right Ratings section of the profile pages. You will notice that you can now quickly see how many ones, threes, and fives each user has received by looking at the rating box on their profile page. The number of ratings listed at the bottom of the profiles has been limited to the most recent twenty, but all ratings are viewable on each member’s rating page.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ratingbox.gif"><img src="http://www.rljart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/ratingbox.gif" alt="" title="ratingbox" width="314" height="198" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1456" /></a></p>

<p>On all profile pages you can now click on the numbers under any of the profile rating box categories to see all of those types of ratings displayed in the center column of the page. (For example, you can click on the number of hearts to see all of the ratings given to the swapper that contained hearts.) You can then click on the swapper’s name to be taken back to their profile or continue browsing their ratings using the rating filter options in the upper right corner. Play around and try out different viewing options!</p>

<p>You can now view the swaps for which you (or others) have received coordinator stars! When you click on the number of stars on any profile, you are shown a linked list of the star swaps. We promised that feature a long time ago, and now it is finally possible!</p>

<p><strong>STUFF</strong></p>

<p>We finally have a <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/stuff.php">“Stuff” page</a> ! There you will find links to all of Swap-bot’s web presences (like MySpace and Facebook) as well as tons of cute graphics that you can use on your own blog or website. Feel free to take any of the graphics or link directly to them, but make sure to link to Swap-bot.com.</p>
