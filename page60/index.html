<p>This week’s featured swap is a postcard swap with an intriguing twist. Coordinator, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:carol">carol</a>, has based her <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/42306">Postcard Biography Swap</a> on the art/writing project of <a href="http://www.michael-kimball.com/about.html">Michael Kimball</a>. Kimball writes the entire life stories of individuals (strangers who contact him through his blog) on 4 x 6 postcards, in under 600 words. You can learn more about his project on his <a href="http://www.michael-kimball.com/blog.php">blog</a> and by reading the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106749299">NPR story about him</a>.</p>

<p>For the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/42306">Postcard Biography Swap</a> you will write your own life story (in about 300 words) on postcards and send them to your three partners. From the swap description: <em>“Please don’t just write boring details (although you can include them too), but give us a glimpse into you. What makes you tick? What’s important in your world? Who or what shaped who you are? How?”</em></p>

<p>The swap is international and open to new users, but you must sign up NOW – the sign up deadline is August 15th! I have signed up and I can’t wait to start working on my own mini life story!</p>

<p>I found a fun new blog to share with you called <a href="http://www.indieicing.com/">Indie Icing</a>. It showcases the “sweetest finds in handmade” by featuring the authors’ (Jessica, Christen, and Robin) favorite picks from Etsy.com and other handmade marketplaces. I sometimes find it intimidating to dive right into Etsy to try to find the best stuff, so I appreciate sources like <a href="http://www.indieicing.com/">Indie Icing</a> that help me discover the most talented handmade sellers. The blog is divided into different categories including the general <a href="http://www.indieicing.com/indie-icing/sweet-finds/">Sweet Finds</a>, <a href="http://www.indieicing.com/indie-icing/mini-monday/">Mini Monday collages</a>, <a href="http://www.indieicing.com/indie-icing/business-basics/">Business Basics</a>, and <a href="http://www.indieicing.com/indie-icing/giveaways/">Giveaways</a> . All of the sellers and items featured on Indie Icing are independently chosen and are not influenced by advertising, which makes it feel more like a curated show rather than a promotional tool. The site is updated multiple times per week with new finds and beautiful images. I recommend it to anyone who likes to admire and buy quality handmade goods.</p>

<p>This week we are featuring another Swap-bot-themed swap. This one is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/41830">Ernie the Envie themed craft swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MyAliceFair">MyAliceFair</a> . Ernie is the Swap-bot logo/mascot and for the swap you must create crafts which include his likeness. Here is some more info from the swap description:</p>

<p><em>“For this swap you will have 1 partner. You will send this partner 2 Ernie the Envie themed handmade crafts of your choice. It could be an Ernie themed ATC, an Ernie Stuffie, An Ernie art collage, an Ernie phone charm, An Ernie handmade anything!”</em></p>

<p>The swap is open for sign up through the end of August and all participants must have participated in at least five prior mail swaps and have over a 4.9 overall rating. I have signed up and can’t wait to get started on my Ernie crafts!!</p>

<p>For ideas of what to make, check out some of the great <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/category/swappy-goodness/">Ernie projects</a> that have already been featured here on the blog. I would love to share photos of any of the finished projects from the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/41830">Ernie the Envie themed craft swap</a> on the blog, as well. Send me your photos to rachel [at] Swap-bot.com. Happy swapping!</p>

						<p>In order to make Swap-bot a safer place, we have been listening to user suggestions and have decided to tighten some of the swapping restrictions. The changes we have planned will be implemented in stages so that there is time to adjust and get used to the new system.</p>

<p>The first changes we are making are to the automatic partial suspension system:</p>

<p>Currently, a user is auto suspended (which prevents them from signing up for new swaps and leaving poor ratings) when they have received more than three 1 ratings within the past six months. There is also currently a loophole which prevents users with over a 4.9 rating from being suspended no matter how many 1s they have received. Our very first change will be to remove the 4.9 loophole from the auto suspensions system. That change will be released tonight. That means, that anyone with more than three 1 ratings within the past six months will be auto suspended. The 4.9 loophole was created to protect very prolific swappers, but now that many more people have participated in hundreds of swaps, the loophole seems to be more trouble than help. (Also being released with the changes tonight will be the option for group founders to Dismiss/Cancel pending group invites within their group members page. Finally.)</p>

<p>The second change that will be made to the auto suspension system is to reduce the number of 1 ratings it takes to become auto suspended. We are going to reduce the number of 1s needed for suspension to more than two. That means that once you receive your third 1 rating within six months, you will be automatically partially suspended. This change will happen in a few weeks and there will be more announcements before it happens.</p>

<p>Another change that we are planning for the near future will put more restrictions on who can host a swap. We plan to only allow users to host swaps once they have completed five swaps and received five 5 ratings. This change will be implemented in a few weeks and there will be more info/announcements about the change before it happens.</p>

<p>I hope this early notice will help make these changes go smoothly and not shock anyone too much! They shouldn’t make too much of a difference to established Swap-bot swappers, but if you do have some recent 1s on your account you might want to work on getting them rectified as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Let us know if you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns.</p>

						<p>It is the last day of July and I have a big ol’ list of fun links for you! Everything from sewing patterns to crazy sandwiches. Enjoy!</p>

<ul>
  <li>A free detailed sewing pattern for the most adorable <a href="http://www.dana-made-it.com/2008/07/tutorial-market-skirt.html">toddler market skirt</a> is available on the <a href="http://www.dana-made-it.com/">Dana Made It blog</a>. (via <a href="http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2009/07/how-to_make_toddler_market_ski.html?CMP=OTC-5JF307375954">Craft:</a>)</li>
  <li>Ever wanted to scrapbook the photos you have on your iPhone? Soon you will be able to with a new scrapbooking iPhone App called <a href="http://blog.coolibah.me/2009/07/moving-right-along.html">Coolibah</a>!</li>
  <li>I just discovered <a href="http://www.i-do-it-yourself.com/">iDIY</a> . It is a site all about Do It Yourself weddings, but the free printable downloads offered on the blog (like these <a href="http://www.i-do-it-yourself.com/2009/07/free-vintage-apothecary-style-labels/">labels</a>, and these <a href="http://www.i-do-it-yourself.com/2009/07/free-printable-personal-notecards-parsiri/">notecards</a>) are awesome and would be great for lots of projects.</li>
  <li>Travis found this little gem: <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ny/inspiration/knitted-chairs-crafted-cozies-for-plastic-chairs-091197">knitted cozies for plastic lawn chairs</a> – crazy, but cute!</li>
  <li>There is an easy sewing pattern and tutorial for making a <a href="http://www.etsy.com/storque/how-to/how-tuesday-tool-apron-from-sew-what-bags-4498/">Tool Apron</a> on the the Etsy Storque. It was created by the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603420924?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=etsy-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1603420924"><em>Sew What! Bags</em></a>, Lexie Barnes.</li>
  <li>These <a href="http://planetjune.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=11_22&amp;products_id=65">AmiDogs patterns</a> for sale on Planet June are so adorable! (They are original crochet amigurumi dog patterns by June Gilbank.) I think the Boston Terrier looks like <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Crusher">Crusher</a>.</li>
  <li>For all of you digital designers out there, this <a href="http://www.degraeve.com/color-palette/">Color Palette Generator</a> is pretty sweet. You simply choose a photo from anywhere on the web and it creates a palette from the colors in the image. (via <a href="http://creaturecomforts.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/07/web-help-color-palette-generator.html">Creature Comforts</a>)</li>
  <li>Ok, this is just for giggles (or gross outs) – check out the crazy sandwiches on <a href="http://www.insanewiches.com/">Insanewiches.com</a>. The <a href="http://www.insanewiches.com/?p=808">Rubix Cubewich</a> might be the best one…</li>
</ul>

<p>Now for two little self-promoting items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is most definitely going to be the featured swap next week, but I wanted to give it a shout-out early: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/41830">The Ernie the Envie craft swap</a> (hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:MyAliceFair">MyAliceFair</a>. Ernie is the Swap-bot logo/mascot. Sign up for the swap to create Swap-bot-themed crafts for your partner… I want to post all of the adorable creations here on the blog!</li>
  <li>My friend, Jennifer (of <a href="http://www.piddleloop.com/blog">Piddleloop</a> fame), and I have started a fun, new Flickr group: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1184846@N22/">Mugshot Thursdays</a>. We take a PhotoBooth photo of ourselves every Thursday with our coffee mug (or tea mug… or milk mug… any mug) and add it to the photo pool. There are ten people currently in the group, but everyone is welcome to join in on the fun. Come show off your mug collection and your lovely face!</li>
</ul>

						<h1><a class="post-link" href="/2009/07/30/cool-free-downloads-from-swap-botters/">Free downloads from Swap-botters</a></h1>
						<p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2009-07-30T07:26:35-04:00" itemprop="datePublished">Jul 30, 2009</time> • <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">rachel</span></span></p>

						<p>Two of your fellow swappers have generously offered to share some free downloadable templates with you. Check ’em out!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/250matchboxtemplatelarge1.jpg">  <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/250matchboxtemplatesmall.jpg" alt="250matchboxtemplatesmall" title="250matchboxtemplatesmall" width="470" height="396" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2125" /></a></p>

<p>This matchbox template was created by Swap-bot user, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:HelenJoy">HelenJoy</a>. It is for the larger, 250-count matchbox (approximately 4.75 x 2.75 x1.2 inches in size). Click on the image to go to the correct (larger) image size for the template. Then, save it to your computer and print it out – make sure to print it at 100%, not “scale to fit page.” (The template with both parts won’t fit on a single 8.5 x 11 piece of paper so you will either need cut it apart in an image editing program or download the two parts <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/250matchbox_inside.jpg">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/250matchbox_outside.jpg">here</a>.) The larger matchboxes need to be constructed from something stiffer than card stock, like a cereal box or light cardboard. Let us know if you have any tips or suggestions for constructing them successfully.</p>

<p><a href="http://sokkiesspot.blogspot.com/2009/07/bit-of-whimsys-christmas-in-july-give.html"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/atcbasicskit.jpg" alt="atcbasicskit" title="atcbasicskit" width="470" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2127" /></a></p>

<p>Another great download comes from user, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:IlonaH">IlonaH</a>. She has created an ATC basics kit which is free for download on her personal website. <a href="http://sokkiesspot.blogspot.com/2009/07/bit-of-whimsys-christmas-in-july-give.html">Click here to be taken to “My other life,” Ilona’s blog and the place where you can download her kit.</a> Her kit has an ATC template, plus some digital papers that she has created to get you started making Artist Trading Cards on the computer. A very cool freebie for those interested in trying out some digital crafting!</p>

<p>Thank you, Helen and Ilona, for your nice work and generosity! If there is anyone else out there who would like to share any free templates, patterns, or tutorials, please let me know (email rachel [at] swap-bot.com). I would love to share your projects on the blog.</p>

<p>This large and beautiful bag with a sweet Ernie the Envie softie charm was made by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Meitalt">Meitalt</a> for her partner in the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/39516">I Love Swap-bot Handmade Item swap</a>, which she also hosted. The image on the right is a close-up of the hanging Ernie charm. Meitalt made the bag nice and large so that it can be used for taking swap packages to and from the post office. What an amazing handmade item for her lucky partner to receive!!</p>

<p>For the same swap, I (<a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:racheljohnson">racheljohnson</a>) crocheted this portrait of Ernie for my partner. I had a lot of fun working on him and am happy with how cute he turned out despite my low level embroidery skills.</p>

<p><em>Ernie the Envie is the Swap-bot mascot/logo. I would love to post any handmade Ernie creations on the Swap-bot blog. Feel free to use any of the graphics on the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/stuff.php">Stuff page</a> in your projects and email your finished photos to rachel [at ] swap-bot.com.</em></p>

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This week’s featured swap is a creative craft project that will help you get ready for back-to-school time. It is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/41081">Altered School Notebook Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:sewcrafty">sewcrazy</a>. For the swap, you purchase a blank school notebook and alter the cover according to your partner’s preferences. You can request that your partner create a notebook for your child who is heading back to school, or one for yourself. Make sure to post your preference in the swap’s comment section after signing up! The completed notebooks could be used for homework or as a journal or sketchbook. The swap is international and it is open for sign up through the end of July. To join in you must have already completed at least five mail swaps and received five 5 ratings. Have fun decorating those notebooks!</p>
