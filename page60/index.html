<p>We have been going through a dry spell in regard to giveaways here on the Swap-bot blog, but we are back with a bang! I have an amazing set of ATC-related goodies to send to one lucky winner. The set includes the , which comes with 20 blank ATC cards that are pre-punched to hang on the carousel, plus (to use with your existing ATCs to hang them on the carousel), (for organizing your ATCs on the carousel), and the special (which creates the perfect little notches used to hang cards on the carousel).</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/atcgiveaway.jpg" alt="atcgiveaway" title="atcgiveaway" width="470" height="540" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2590" /></p>

<p>It is a really nice set of ATC tools – over $50 in value! I have been intrigued by the 7 gypsies carousel ever since I saw it online, but I recently saw one in action at a craft store and I was impressed. It is made of heavy metal and the cards actually attach to it pretty securely, but they are also easily removed and switched around. If you are not into ATCs, the carousel can be used as a mini, vertical scrapbook of sorts. You can put photos in the sleeves and decorate the cards with journaling or more photos.</p>

<p>Because this giveaway is slightly larger than usual, there are two ways to enter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Post a comment here on the blog telling us about your favorite ATC you have made or received, and/or…
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Post about Swap-bot (it can be about this giveaway, or about Swap-bot in general) somewhere on the web (your blog, twitter, a public forum) and link to your post in your comment. &lt;/ol&gt; 
Make sure to include your Swap-bot username and email address in your comment or your entry will not be counted. Each person can enter this giveaway drawing up to two times by making both types of comments. Please make a separate comment for each entry. The deadline for entering this giveaway is Friday, September 18th. The winner will be randomly drawn and announced on Sunday, September 20th. If you have trouble commenting on the blog, you can send me an email at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. Good luck!</p>

        <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A few of your comments got caught in our spam filter, but I think I have approved them all as of today (9/10/09) and they should be showing up below. I will continue to check through the spam comments to see if it mislabeled any legitimate comments. I don’t want anyone to miss out on this giveaway!</p>

It is called and it allows you “give any digital photo the classic look and feel of a vintage or Polaroid picture.” It is a super-simple site to use (you do not have to create an account, which is a huge relief – no need to enter all of your contact info again, like on most other sites) and it offers a bunch of funky effects that you can use on your own photos. I created the two images below using two different Polaroid styles on the site.</p>

This week’s swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/43330">teeny tiny stuffie swap #4</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:Carotte">Carotte</a>. I can’t believe there have been three previous version of this swap that I missed!</p>

<p>For the swap, you send one miniature stuffie (“It can be sewn, felted, crocheted… if it’s small and ‘soft’ it should be ok”) to one partner. The theme is open, but checking out your partner’s profile is always cool. More info from the swap description: “Note that the final stuffie is going to be quite small, so work with care and minutia, and maybe do a test run before joining the swap if you are not sure you can make it. They can use a really small amount of fabric/felt.” The swap is international, but you must have a 4.9 overall rating, or higher, to participate. Be sure to sign up before the deadline on August 29th!</p>

<p>For some inspiration, Carotte has some wonderful examples of super-tiny stuffies on her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carotte/3682147945/">Flickr</a>. (I am in love with the little rain cloud!)</p>

		<p>I apologize for the one week outage of Chat, but it has finally been fixed. During the outage I took the opportunity to move the chat server to a new host to hopefully improve performance. I have also taken additional measures to prevent this from happening again.</p>

<p>Sorry again for the disturbance in service,</p>

<p>This week’s featured swap is a postcard swap with an intriguing twist. Coordinator, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:carol">carol</a>, has based her <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/42306">Postcard Biography Swap</a> on the art/writing project of <a href="http://www.michael-kimball.com/about.html">Michael Kimball</a>. Kimball writes the entire life stories of individuals (strangers who contact him through his blog) on 4 x 6 postcards, in under 600 words. You can learn more about his project on his <a href="http://www.michael-kimball.com/blog.php">blog</a> and by reading the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106749299">NPR story about him</a>.</p>

<p>For the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/42306">Postcard Biography Swap</a> you will write your own life story (in about 300 words) on postcards and send them to your three partners. From the swap description: <em>“Please don’t just write boring details (although you can include them too), but give us a glimpse into you. What makes you tick? What’s important in your world? Who or what shaped who you are? How?”</em></p>

<p>The swap is international and open to new users, but you must sign up NOW – the sign up deadline is August 15th! I have signed up and I can’t wait to start working on my own mini life story!</p>
