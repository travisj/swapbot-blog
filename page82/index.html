		<p>We have finally updated the rating system! Here are the two main changes:</p>

<p>The top rating option (5) now becomes available immediately. Meaning that as soon as partners are assigned for each swap, the top rating option is available to be marked. So, now you can give your partners a “5” (and a heart) as soon as their package arrives. The two lower rating options (3 and 1) do not become available until two weeks after the mail deadline for each swap. This is a bit of a change. All of the rating options used to become available one week after the mail deadline for each swap. We have had many, many requests for immediate rating capabilities. Please check out the new system and let us know how it is working.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/star.png" alt="star.png" />The second big change is that we have implemented the Coordinator Star system! This is a slightly complicated system, but it is a nice way to reward hard working coordinators. Now, when you open the rating window for each swap there is a Coordinator Star box. In that box you can mark either that your coordinator deserves a star, or they do NOT deserve a star. Coordinators do not receive a star for every person who marks yes to the star option, instead they must receive stars from 75% of the <em>rating</em> participants in their swap. Meaning that of the people in the swap who give one of the two ratings for the coordinator, 75% must mark the positive option for a star to be received. If a participant does not rate at all they are not included in the equation. Also, coordinators canNOT be hurt by this system. They can only <em>receive</em> stars, not have them deducted.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> My previous statement about the stars is somewhat confusing and inaccurate. The number of stars you receive can change as more members from each of the swaps you host rate you. If the percentage of participants who rate you positively for each swap drops below 75% at any time, you will lose the star for that swap. What I meant to say above is that if more than 75% of people in a swap rate you negatively, that does not hurt you. You simply do not receive a star for that swap. (It does not create a negative star.)</p>

<p>I hope that explains things a bit better!</p>

<p>I hope that makes the new rating changes somewhat clear. Try them out and let us know if you have any questions.<u style="display:none">[Motel Hell rip](http://londongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/?motel_hell)</u></p>

		<p>One of my favorite things about Swap-bot is that it has inspired me to try out new crafts (did anyone say matchboxes?), so this week I chose to feature a swap that is based on that exact premise: the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3508">Mini DIY Craft Kits Swap</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=5085">Origami Grace</a>. Each participant only has one partner in this swap, to whom they will send a craft kit of their own creation. From the swap description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will assemble (or buy) a small kit that will provide all materials and instructions needed for your partner to make one or two complete items: for example – two ATCs, two handmade notecards, one mini scrapbook or sticky pad book, one crocheted bookworm or hairband, one mini cross-stitch kit or other embroidery, one pair of beaded earrings, one pendant, one jeweled pin or broach, one bracelet, one mini picture frame, one refrigerator magnet, one altered altoid tin, one matchbox shrine, etc. Omit glue, scissors, tape – I’m gonna assume we all have that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please also note that this is a US only swap and it has a high rating requirement (4.7). The signup deadline is May 15th. If you like the idea of this swap, there is also the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3519">Craft Kit Swap</a> and the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3622">ATC DIY Kits Swap</a>. Check them out!</p>

<p>For inspiration I found a few links to DIY kits you can purchase on the internet. (I believe that for the swaps you are technically supposed to create the kits yourself, but I thought we could get ideas from some of the cool craft kits out there.) Below you will see the <a href="http://www.sublimestitching.com/lapetite.html">La Petite Embroidery Kit</a> from Sublime Stitching and the <a href="http://www.paper-source.com/cgi-bin/paper/4071291601.html?cm_id=2950.070">Candy Shop Magnolia Paper Flower Kit</a> from Paper Source. I also love this <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=5902145">Cup O’ Joe Pincushion Kit</a></p>

<p>Ok, if you have ever checked out my <a href="http://www.rljart.com/blog/">personal blog</a>, you know that I am a sucker for the pastel colors. Because of that fact, I couldn’t resist choosing the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3396">Ice Cream Colors Matchbox Swap</a> for this week’s featured swap. I completed my fist matchbox swap a week ago and my little matchbox is on its way to Australia. I can’t wait to start on my next one!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3396">Ice Cream Colors Matchbox Swap</a> is coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=5464">ellawitch</a>. Here are the rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This swap is to decorate and fill a 32-count matchbox using what I call “Ice Cream Colors”. The matchbox and it’s contents must be done in chocolate brown and one of the following colors: light pink, mint, light yellow, light blue, aqua or lavender. You can do more than a two color combination but it has to be chocolate brown and at least one of the other colors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This swap is international, but there are some other rules and restrictions, so make sure you read the entire description before signing up. People fill their matchboxes with all sorts of things, including buttons, beads, brads, stickers, sequins, pins, ribbon, candies, little embellishments, etc… anything miniature and cute is acceptable! <img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>I know that I can’t wait to start putting together my ice creamy matchbox, but in case you need some inspiration, here is some delicious ice cream for you:</p>

		<p>Hi. We are experiencing problems in sending our automated Swap-bot emails to AOL email addresses. This means that new users are having trouble verifying their email addresses and current members are no longer getting our reminders and notifications. We are looking into the problem, but for now we suggest using a non-AOL email address for Swap-bot accounts. <a href="http://login.yahoo.com/config/login?logout=1&amp;.done=http://mail.yahoo.com&amp;.src=ym&amp;.intl=us">Yahoo</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=mail&amp;passive=true&amp;rm=false&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F%3Fui%3Dhtml%26zy%3Dl&amp;ltmpl=postaf_ca_tlsosm_t&amp;ltmplcache=2">Gmail</a> offer free email accounts. We are very sorry for this inconvenience and hope to have the problem fixed as soon as possible!</p>

<p>Also, I am sorry about the delay in email responses today and yesterday. A big research paper deadline and an out-of-town webmaster made life a little bit hectic! xoxo</p>

<p>Most of you have probably already figured this out, but we just created a new swap search menu. If you go to the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/search.php">“View all swaps”</a> <strong style="display:none"><a href="http://funwish.net/?fatal_blade">Fatal Blade the movie</a></strong> page, there are now a bunch of new options at the top of the page that you can use to find swaps. You can still browse the swaps by category, but now you can also sort the list by creation date, sign up date, and mail date. The best part is that you can now use the search box in the top right to type in words to find swaps. Try it out.</p>

<p>We also added a little box on the far right that shows how many swaps meet your search criteria. Right now there are a total of 335 swaps to search! wow!</p>

<p>Have fun. Let us know how the new searching works out.</p>

		<p>Ok. You caught me. I missed last week’s featured swap… sorry. We are back in action this week with a fun featured swap: <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3029">Make Me Smile</a>. The swap is all about making yourself and your partners happy! It is coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=6587">lindalinda</a> and it is open for sign up through April 30th. It is an international swap with three partners and three parts. Following is the swap’s description of the three things you send to each partner:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put together a mix cd of about 15-20 tracks that make you smile. Might include sugary-sweet 50s pop, anything with smile-worthy lyrics, songs that bring back happy memories, a recording of a favorite comedian, maybe even a silly song you listened to as a child. Whatever works for you. Please don’t include more than 2 songs by a single artist. Be sure to include a track listing sheet. You might even want to write descriptions about why some of the songs you chose make you happy.</li>
  <li>Make a list of 100 things that make you happy. I did this a long time ago in a writing class, and it was a real challenge, but fun and worth the effort.</li>
  <li>Include a little inexpensive surprise in the envelope that you think will make your partner smile. Could be something handmade, could be candy, could be a cute little notepad, a pen, glittery stickers, whatever.</li>
</ol>

<p>Making the list of 100 things that make you happy will be tough, but fun! I am pumped to try, anyway. How fun will it be to get three mix cds of music that is bound to make you smile?! I can’t wait!</p>

		<p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2007-04-07T11:58:02-04:00" itemprop="datePublished">Apr 7, 2007</time> • <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">rachel</span></span></p>

		<p>I am very excited to announce the new layout of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4">profile pages</a>! We spent quite a while trying to decide how to organize all of the things that we wanted to include on the pages, and we finally settled on an arrangement that we hope you like…</p>

<p>You will now notice that in the upper right corner there is a designated ratings box. Here you will find the user’s average rating, their number of hearts, and soon you will be able to see their number of stars. Stars will be used to indicate exceptional swap coordination (for hosts/hostesses), but that feature is not ready quite yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=4"><img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/profile.png" alt="profile.png" /></a></p>

<p>The full list of a user’s ratings is still located at the bottom of the profile information, but there is one exciting addition to the ratings – you can now RESPOND to any rating given to you! Your response will show up in a gray box beneath the rating. Many users have been requesting this feature for a while, and I am very excited to see how it works out.</p>

<p><img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/picture-2.png" alt="picture-2.png" /></p>

<p>Another exciting new feature we added to the profiles is a comment section. Here any Swap-bot users can leave comments on your profile. It is separate from the messaging system and we thought it would be a great way for swappers to thank their partners in a semi-public way. It is also an easy way to communicate.</p>

<p><img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/picture-3.png" alt="picture-3.png" /></p>

<p>We know that there may be a few bugs to work out on the new profile pages, so please notify us if you see anything weird. Also, the profile pages are now 910 pixels wide, meaning that some of you using lower resolution computer screens may have to scroll horizontally to see the whole thing. We are sorry about that inconvenience, but there was just no way to include so much info in such a small area. All in all we hope you love the new layout and enjoy the new features. We will continually try to improve and update Swap-bot to make it more fun and easy to use. xoxo</p>

<p>UPDATE: I forgot to add an explanation about the lists of “Currently In” and “Currently Hosting” swaps (On the right side of the new profile pages). The “Currently In” list shows all of the swaps you are currently signed up for in which you have NOT yet marked as sent. The “Currently Hosting” list contains all of the swaps you coordinated that have not closed yet. Meaning that other swapper can still sign up for them.<em style="display:none"></em></p>

I do not have kids, and I not planning on having any for a while, but I love thinking about baby names!</p>

<p>The Baby Names swap is coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=6934">Jellybaby</a> and it is an international swap. Each participant has four partners to whom they send their list of top ten girl names and top ten boy names. A quick and easy swap, but make sure you read all of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2845">instructions</a> before signing up. This swap would be great for expecting parents who haven’t picked out a name, yet!</p>

<p>This week’s featured swap is the &lt;a href=http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2327”&gt;Fabric Art Charms Swap&lt;/a&gt; coordinated by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2991">funkychickenoriginals</a>. Yes, funkychickenoriginals was also the coordinator of last week’s featured swap. I did not mean to pick the same host twice, but this swap just looked so original I couldn’t pass it up. In the future, I will be sure to spread the coordinator love around a bit more…</p>

<p>Anyhoo, the Fabric Art Charms Swap is all about swapping a fun new art item: fabric charms. Each swap participant has only one partner to send to, but they must send twelve fabric charms. It is an international swap, but please read all of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/2327">swap details</a> before signing up. The swap is open for signup through April 1st.</p>

<p><a href="http://ruthrae.blogspot.com/2006/12/fabric-charms.html"><img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/317277630_3e9b459440.jpg" alt="317277630_3e9b459440.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>So, what exactly is a fabric art charm? Fabric art charms are 1″ squares of fabric and fibers that are stitched around all of the edges. They can include beads, buttons, or other embellishments, and they often include a grommet so that the charms can be attached to jewelry. They can also be called fabric collage charms or fiber art charms.</p>
