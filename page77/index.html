		<p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2008-03-02T07:06:42-05:00" itemprop="datePublished">Mar 2, 2008</time> • <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">rachel</span></span></p>

	<div>
		<p>We have been working on a few small site changes this weekend. Here are the details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Swap partners are no longer auto assigned. This has been a confusing subject mostly due to my own mistakes and bad info, however we have now come to a solution which we believe will be most effective. Coordinators are now completely responsible for assigning partners for their swaps. The Swap-bot computer will NOT auto-assign partners at any time. Coordinators have one week (7 days) to assign partners for their swaps. If partners are not assigned within one week the swap is DELETED by the Swap-bot computer. All participants will receive an email letting them know that the swap was deleted. 
<em style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?air_force_one">Air Force One on dvd</a></em> Side note: If a swap has been deleted because the coordinator has not logged in for over a week and never assigned partners, we consider it perfectly acceptable for one of the swap’s participants to start a similar swap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You can now drop from swaps at any time before partners are assigned. Before you could not drop from a swap if the sign up deadline had passed, now you can drop after the sign up deadline if partners are not assigned.</li>
  <li>I have revised the FAQ to reflect these changes, but as always let me know if you notice any errors.</li>
  <li>One more little change for group founders: We have added the date that users requested to join a group under their info on the group “Approve Join Requests” pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you like these changes. Happy swapping!</p>

<p>UPDATE: My wording above may be slightly confusing. Coordinators do not actually have to pair up the participants in their swaps, they simply have to initiate the process by clicking the “assign partners” link. The Swap-bot computer still matches all partners. It just does not ever initiate that process automatically. Sorry for any confusion.<strong style="display:none"><a href="http://utero.pe/?hondo">Hondo dvdrip</a></strong></p>

	<div>
		<p>Do <strong>not</strong> use your swap partners’ contact information to send unsolicited emails, advertisements, junk mail, or chain letters. Chain letters are <a href="http://www.usps.com/postalinspectors/fraud/chainlet.htm">illegal</a> and everything else is super annoying. If you are found to be sending unsolicited material to your Swap-bot contacts your account will be suspended.</p>

<p>Swap-bot has never, and will never, give, rent, or sell your contact information to any third party. It is only released to your swap partners and coordinators on this site.<strong style="display:none"><a href="http://londongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/?twisted">Twisted download</a><br /></strong></p>

		<p>We finally just jumped in and did it – we have publicly released the Swap-bot Groups system. The system is still a bit clunky and definitely not perfect, but if we waited for perfection nothing would ever get done!</p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://cigaretteshere.biz/" title="buy cigarettes online">buy cigarettes online</a>
</div>

<p>So, what does this mean? It means that everyone can now (easily) create and search for groups! The <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/index.php">“Find Groups”</a> link is now located on the left sidebar of non-forum Swap-bot pages. There you can search for groups that match your interests and go to their homepage to request to join. Or, you can create your own group! Have fun!</p>

<p><strong>GENERAL GROUP INFO</strong></p>

<p>Swap-bot groups were created to better enhance the swapping community. You can create groups around any interest, demographic or anything you choose! Multiple groups may be created that address similar interests. That is ok. Everyone is free to create any groups they want. However, kindness and consideration are always appreciated. If you plan to create a group that is identical to one already in existence, it would be best to contact the other group’s founder first…</p>

<p><strong>Membership Levels</strong></p>

<p>There are three different levels of group membership:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Member:</strong> Group Members join group swaps and participate in the group-specific forum.</li>
  <li><strong>Officer:</strong> Group Officers have the same privileges as Group Members, plus they can create group swaps and invite other Swap-bot members to their group.</li>
  <li><strong>Founder:</strong> Group Founders have the same privileges as Group Officers, plus they can approve group join requests, remove Members or Officers from the group, promote or demote Members and Officers. In addition, Group Founders have swap coordinator privileges for any group swaps (even if they did not create the swap). At this time each group can only have one founder. In the future we hope to make it so that there can be multiple founders.</li>
</ol>

<p>FYI: In the future we hope to make the group membership levels more fluid and changeable…</p>

<p><strong>Groups Swaps</strong></p>

<p>Only those Swap-bot members that belong to the group can join a group swap. (The Swap-bot computer prevents non-members from signing up.) Group swaps are not listed on the public search page or any of the swap lists. However, group swaps are listed on member profile pages and are not meant to be hidden from non group members.</p>

<p><strong>Accepting new members</strong></p>

<p>In addition to forming niche swapping communities, Groups can be used to ensure you only swap with other members you trust. If you are a Founder or Officer in a group it is your responsibility to the group to ensure that only trustworthy swappers make it into your group. <em>Swap-bot admin cannot help with any group conflicts.</em></p>

<p>—–</p>

<p>We are very excited about Swap-bot Groups… but it has proven to be a much larger endeavor than first thought. There is still much work to be done. Please explore the system and give us any feedback you have. Like all of Swap-bot, Groups are an evolving and constantly improving entity.</p>

<p>The Group Beta Testers have been an awesome help. They have given us tons of suggestions, many of which we are still working to implement. If you are a member of the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/30b241498eececb662539242308e5c6e/about">Swap-bot Beta Testers group</a></p>

<p>, please go to the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/group/30b241498eececb662539242308e5c6e/about">homepage</a> for information about adding a special beta tester badge to your profile.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone for your help and patience!</p>

<p>Happy swapping,</p>

<p>Rachel</p>

<p>Swap-bot Admin</p>

		<p>I have a few updates to tell you about…</p>

<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://cheapbuycigarettesonline.com/" title="buy cigarettes">buy cigarettes</a>
</div>

<p>1 – “Your Swaps” has been changed to “My Swaps”. It is just a word change and the link still goes to the same page. It is a change which lays the ground work for the site to be consistent as we add features in future.</p>

<p>2 – We have implemented a new user swap sign up limit. All new users of Swap-bot now start with a five swap limit. They can only sign up for five active swaps at a time at first. This limit lasts until they have received three positive (5) ratings from their swap partners. Once they have received three positive ratings, the swap sign up limit is completely removed and they can sign up for as many swaps as they would like. This is the first time we have implemented any type of swap limit, so we may make adjustments as we receive feedback. Also, this new feature is not retroactive.</p>

<p>3 – Swap-bot Groups are slowly being tested and released. To learn about being a group beta tester <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/6077">go here</a></p>

<div style="display:none">
  <a href="http://utero.pe/?the_omen">The Omen film</a>
</div>

<p>. There will be much more info about groups provided once we get closer to officially releasing the system. They will basically be a way to organize swapping and chatting among communities with similar interests. Any members with over five “5” ratings will be able to create groups, and each group will have a home page, private forum, and group-only swaps. Pretty cool. We are excited about the possibilities!</p>

<p>4 – The [FAQ page]((http://www.swap-bot.com/faq.php) <em style="display:none"><a href="http://www.turtlesurvival.org/?jumper">Jumper full</a></em> is constantly being updated, so check it out when you have questions. If you don’t see your question there, please let me know so that we can add it.</p>

<p>Ok, that is about it for now… but stay tuned for info and announcements about GROUPS!</p>

		<p>Like many Swap-bot users, I received an outrageous “investment opportunity” message in my Swap-bot inbox on Thursday morning from user, sand208karaka. If you received a message from sand208karaka please know that it is a scam and delete the message. This bogus user was able to spam hundreds of Swap-bot members in a very short time. However, the account was quickly shut down and the user can no longer log into Swap-bot or participate in any way on our site.</p>

<p>We do not allow spam of any type on Swap-bot. I you receive any other messages that you believe are spam, please forward them to me at rachel [at] swap-bot.com. We may implement additional security features in the future which will further prevent spam from being sent to our users. I will keep you posted.</p>

		<p>Hi swap buddies!</p>

<p>Just wanted to let everyone know that we have created a few new swap and forum categories. Here are the additions we made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New “Ephemera” swap category</li>
  <li>New “Children’s Items” swap category</li>
  <li>New “Tag and Trade Problems” forum sub-category under the “One-on-One Trades” main category</li>
</ul>
<div style="display: none">
  <a href="http://howtooearnmoneyonline.com/" title="make money online">make money online</a>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>New “Real Life/Off Topic” forum sub-category under the “Fun” main category</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all in response to user suggestions. Thanks for all of your help!</p>

<p>Also, we are currently working on a new user swap limit and a groups feature which will hopefully both be released in some capacity on Sunday. For more info on the groups feature, check out <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/5870">this forum thread</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Saturday!</p>

<p>above was started by user, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=9869">kassrose</a>, on Buddymapping.com. It shows the location of all the Swap-bot users who have added themselves to the map. You can add yourself to it by visiting <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=9869">BuddyMapping</a> and clicking on the “Add yourself to the map” link in the bottom right of the screen. It is fun to see where everyone is located. We are excited that there are people from all over the world participating on Swap-bot!</p>

<p>For comparison, here is the visitor map generated by our site statistics. It maps every traceable* location where someone has visited Swap-bot.com in the last thirty days. (We haven’t posted a user map like this since <a href="http://blog.swap-bot.com/2006/05/09/visitors-from-around-the-globe/">May of 2006</a></p>

<p>!)</p>

		<p>We have been working hard this weekend to release some pretty cool site updates for you today. The site changes/improvements are listed below. Check them out and let us know how you like them or if you notice anything weird going on. Thanks! xoxo</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Most important:</strong> The <a href="http://swap-bot.com/blog/2007/11/24/automatic-account-suspensions/">automatic account suspension system</a> is now completely operational. This means that if a swapper receives four, or more, “1” ratings within the past six months, their account is automatically partially suspended by the Swap-bot computer. They are dropped from all swaps in which partners are not yet assigned and they are not able to sign up for new swaps until they get their low ratings rectified. This means that if you have four, or more, “1” ratings from the past six months on your account right now, you will not be allowed to sign up for any new swaps until you are able to improve some of those ratings.</li>
  <li>There are three new email notifications that you will be receiving: (1) when/if your account is partially suspended due to four, or more, “1” ratings; (2) when a rating you have given receives a response; (3) when you receive a comment on your profile. The last two email notifications have been requested by many users, but we have also made them optional if you prefer. To “opt out” of the rating response and profile comment email notifications, go to the new <strong>Preferences</strong> section of the profile edit screen. You can also choose not to receive the email notification for new ratings on this screen. The default is set so that you DO receive all email notifications. You must edit your profile preferences to stop receiving any of the three optional notifications. (Many Swap-bot email notifications, such as those for swap deadlines, are not optional at this time.)</li>
  <li>Your country is now listed on your profile page under last login. This is NOT optional at this time. Your country is listed exactly as you typed it in you account address.</li>
  <li>Your current swaps on the “Your Swaps” page are now listed by mail deadline instead of sign up deadline. This makes it so that the “Your Swaps” list matches the “Currently In” list on the profile pages.</li>
  <li>You can now mark swaps as NOT sent if/when you accidentally mark them as “Sent” before you mean to. This option is located in the swap’s info box on the swap’s main page to the right of the “Sent Items Status:” field. You cannot perform this option from the “Your Swaps” page; you must view the individual swap page to do it.</li>
  <li>The date that each participant marked a swap as “Sent” is now visible on the “View complete list of swap participants” page. This information is visible for both participants and coordinators of the swap. However, this new bit of information cannot be displayed retroactively, so all swaps that have been marked “Sent” prior to today will not have a date associated with them. Sorry.</li>
  <li>Lastly, the list of recipients you have sent messages to in the Swap-bot message center are now listed in alphabetical order. However, the alphabetical ordering system is not perfect as users who have not logged in for months (and still only have their old display names) are not sorted alphabetically. Their names will appear at the end of the list.</li>
</ul>

<p><u style="display:none">[Secrecy download](http://www.barryshamis.com/?secrecy)</u></p>

<p>We hope you enjoy the new changes. Happy swapping!</p>

		<p>I think everyone has noticed that Swap-bot is super slow today. Travis has been trying to figure it out. He first thought it could have to do with the recent site changes, but it turns out that our hosting company (MediaTemple) is having &lt;a href=http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/web-latency-on-gs-gridcluster1/”&gt;“latency issues”&lt;/a&gt; with the server Swap-bot uses. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Hopefully things will be running fast again soon!</p>
