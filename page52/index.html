Pennant banners (or bunting, or garland, depending on where you are from) are very popular right now, and for good reason! They are a fun and easy way to decorate a space for a party, or for everyday. This swap requires that each participant create their own original pennant banner with five triangles or squares which spell out the word &amp;#8220;DREAM&amp;#8221; attached to a ribbon or cord. The triangles or squares should each be the size of an Artist Trading Card (2.5 x 3.5 inches) and they should be created in a vintage style. 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>More info from the swap description on the style: “Senders choice color-wise, but it MUST be soft and dreamy and vintage in style – a touch of glitter is always nice. You can start creating as soon as you sign up. Think vintage trims and tassels, think ribbon and lace. Vintage embellishments would be nice, but any cute pictures or stickers that match, diamontes or flowers. I usually add a fringe, tassels or beading to each bottom but its up to you.”</p>

<p>The swap is international and open for sign up through February 26th.</p>

		<p class="post-meta"><time datetime="2010-02-09T08:17:11-05:00" itemprop="datePublished">Feb 9, 2010</time> • <span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">rachel</span></span></p>

		<p>We have finally released the new swap coordinator requirements that were previously discussed in the forums . We made these changes to the requirements after receiving a lot of user input about who should be able to host a swap on Swap-bot. These changes will probably not affect any long-time users, but they will change how and when new users can host swaps.</p>

<p>Starting now, you must meet these requirements in order to create any swap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must complete five different swaps (i.e. send and mark five swaps as sent).</li>
  <li>You must have received five 5 ratings (they can be for the same swap, or different swaps).</li>
  <li>You must have LESS than ten 1 ratings in your entire Swap-bot lifetime.</li>
</ul>

<p>And, like always:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must have over a 3.0 average rating.</li>
  <li>You must NOT be suspended in any way (partially of fully) or be underage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any swaps that are already underway will not be affected by this change. I believe these new restrictions will help increase the overall average quality level of swaps hosted on Swap-bot. These restrictions are not perfect – other types of restrictions have been suggested, like restricting each type of swap individually – but I think they are a good start. They are much more strict than the previous requirement of just completing one swap!</p>

<p>Like always, we can override these restrictions if there are new users who have past swapping experience and would like to start hosting on Swap-bot. We still want Swap-bot to be a helpful tool for those who host successful swaps on their blogs, so I will continue to make exceptions for those types of swaps as needed.</p>

<p>Also, these restrictions are probably a lot more lenient than what many Swap-bot users look for in their swap coordinators. Remember to always check out the swap’s host before signing up for a swap. You can set your own personal coordinator requirements and only join swaps hosted by users who meet them. A good swap host makes for a successful swap!</p>

<p>I have a present for you! I got inspired and made these cute Swap-bot Valentines and matching envelope. One features Ernie the envie decked out for the holiday, and the other features Crusher. Crusher loves you!</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/9jvHz7"><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/SwapbotValentines.gif" alt="SwapbotValentines" title="SwapbotValentines" width="470" height="490" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4922" /></a></p>

<p>The PDF file is totally free and you simply download it, print it out on card stock, cut out your Valentines, and give them to your friends! You could also use them as swap cards to include in your swap packages.</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/9jvHz7"><strong>Download the Swap-bot Valentines PDF here.</strong></a></p>

<p>There are some basic instructions on the PDF, but assembly is really easy. Cut just inside the black lines, then score and fold the envelope on the grey lines. Fold in the shorter sides of the envelope, then the bottom. You can glue these parts together. Slip your Valentine card inside the envelope, fold down the top, seal it, and give it to someone you love!</p>

<p>Three Swap-bot members from the met up last Saturday, January 30th. Members (plus her mom), , and all met in Portland, Oregon, at loricritt’s home.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/NWcrafts.jpg" alt="NWcrafts" title="NWcrafts" width="470" height="197" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4912" /></p>

<p>The evening was spent crafting, of course! Tarabell150 brought bottle caps and the necessary tools to show everyone how to make bottle cap buttons, which they painted with alcohol inks. Loricritt supplied the necessities to make glass pendants, and there was also a “show and tell” of ATCs, Skinnys, Inchies, Dotees, and Button Fairies. Sounds like a fun afternoon!</p>

<p><em>If any other Swap-bot groups gather together, please take photos and please let me know about your event! I would love to publish a report like this one here on the blog. You can email me at rachel@swap-bot.com.</em></p>

<p>Whew. What a wonderful time I had last night! Hosting was such a great experience. All of the matchboxes seen above were created by the attendees of the event. They were all so sweet and creative! Swap-bot loves forever!</p>

<p>There were about 30-40 attendees at the in-person event at the Etsy Labs and about 50 people watching the Virtual Labs video tutorial. Thank you to everyone – especially Swap-bot members – who came and watched. Lisa (Swap-bot username ) came to the in-person event early and helped set up, and I know I saw at least one Swap-botter (thanks, !) and my mom in the Virtual Labs! Were any other ‘botters there that I missed?</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mejulie.jpg" alt="mejulie" title="mejulie" width="453" height="362" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4901" /></p>

<p>In addition to the Swap-bot peeps, I met a ton of new people at the Craft Night, like , , Colette, Rachel, Elaine, and so many more. I wish I had taken more time to remember everyone’s names and ask them more about themselves. Alas, I was caught up in trying to explain the matchbox procedure clearly and pushing treats and Swap-bot swag on everyone! I hope they forgive me. Above is a photo of me and , the super-cool organizer of Etsy Craft Nights. She does a great job and she really made the night go smoothly. Travis and our friend, , also came by at the end of the evening and helped me close up shop. Everyone was so helpful, friendly, and supportive. It was a great night.</p>
