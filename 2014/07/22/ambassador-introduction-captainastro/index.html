<p>————</p>

<p><strong>Say hello to our next Ambassador, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CaptainAstro">CaptainAstro</a>!</strong> A lover of all things mail art and stamp collecting, CaptainAstro has been a member of Swap-bot for a little over a year. He is our only <strong>male</strong> Ambassador!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.swap-bot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/eric-bruthblog.jpg" alt="eric-bruthblog" width="300" height="445" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11209" /><strong>Ambassador Region:</strong> Paris, France</p>

<p><strong>CaptainAstro’s Mail Art Website:</strong> <a href="http://mymailartworld.blogspot.com">My Mail Art World</a></p>

<p><strong>How CaptainAstro found Swap-bot:</strong> “I found Swap-bot by reading about it on a mail art blog. I am so curious that right after reading about ‘Swap-bot,’ I googled the name immediatly and ended on the wesbsite. A few minutes later I was registring and very quickly I got involved in my first swap.”</p>

<p><strong>Why he enjoys Swap-bot:</strong> “I enjoy Swap-bot because it is an easy way to be in contact with a lot of different people from all over the world (even if a majority is from US…) to exchange mail art in my case. Each swap is a challenge, whether the subject of the mail art is imposed, or because a color, a shape, or even a technique is imposed. It stimulates my imagination and therefore my creativity. The rating process is also interesting because it helps to receive feedback on what you sent. I take as much pleasure in sending a swap then receiving one! I think it is a pitty that there aren’t more people from Europe (or even from France) and also more males on swap-bot. I sometimes feel alone surrounded by women ;-)”</p>

<p><strong>His favorite type of swap:</strong> “My favorite swaps are mail art exchange, of course.” <em>Check out one of his mail art creations below…</em></p>

<p><strong>An interesting fact about CaptainAstro:</strong> “I’m very fond of frogs! Not because I’m French. (I have never eaten frogs. Opposed to the legend, it is not so common in France to eat frogs.) I really love frogs. When I was younger I had a collection of frogs coming from different parts of the world. I had plastic frogs, wood frogs etc. After some time my collection became too large and I decided to stop and concentrated on collecting stamps picturing frogs. It gave me the opportunity to come back to an old hobby: stamp collection. Thanks to my frog stamp collection, a philatelic news paper contected me for an interview. I was proud that my collection could be mentioned in a paper that I read every month. After this publication, one reader wrote to me. He sent me a letter decorated with a frog. This was the first piece of mail art that I received. I then started to look around to find information about mail art and I quickly became hooked. Frogs have become a sort of signature in my mail art. I use them as often as I can!”</p>

<p><em>I hope you liked our fourth Ambassador interview and introduction. If you are interested in philately, mail art, France, or frogs, contact <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/user:CaptainAstro">CaptainAstro</a>.</em></p>
