</ul>

<p>I am always on the look-out for unique swaps to feature… the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6794">Camera and Flat Shirley Swap</a> definitely meets that criteria. The swap is hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=2991">funkychicken</a> and it is a somewhat complicated two-step swap, so please read the entire swap description before signing up.</p>

<p>Basically, each participant creates a “flat shirley” of themselves – a small paper body with a picture of themselves for its head, based loosely on the &lt;a h</p>

<div style="display: none">
  ex gf <a href="http://exbacksms.com/">exbacksms.com</a> How to win back your ex
</div>

<p>ref=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060097914/susanreynolar-20″&gt;Flat Stanley books&lt;/a&gt; – and sends it along with a disposable camera to their partner. The flat shirley stays with the partner for a month and travels around with the person getting its photo taken in various locations. When the month is up, the partner sends back the full camera and flat shirley back to the original creator. This swap should make for some funny and surprising photos of each little “mini me”!</p>

<p>The swap is international, but requires a 4.7 rating or higher. There are more guidelines and detailed information on the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6794">swap’s home page</a></p>

<p>. Happy swapping!</p>

		<p>This week we are featuring a very unique and clever swap hosted by <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=7606">spoonergregory</a> <strong style="display:none"><a href="http://www.barryshamis.com/?banshee_">Banshee!!! psp</a></strong> called <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6020">Art from Start to Finish</a>. This extremely creative international swap is open to experienced participants who have over a 4.5 rating. The purpose of the swap is to “find out about the process that other people go through when they make a piece of original artwork.” For the swap you create one original piece of artwork (any medium except photography or ATCs) and document the entire process. Each participant will send their one partner the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The piece of original artwork created for this swap.&lt;/a&gt;
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A letter explaining your creative process. This can be t &lt;div style="display: none"&gt;
  <a href="http://capturehislove.com/" title="relationship advice">relationship advice</a>
&lt;/div&gt;</p>

        <p>yped or handwritten, but must be at least two pages.&lt;/li&gt;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A photograph of the materials you used.</li>
          <li>A photograph of your work space.</li>
          <li>At least three photographs of the work at various stages of completion.</li>
          <li>Your early sketches/photographs/ideas that you used as inspiration for the finished piece&lt;/ul&gt;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As you can see, this is a very involved swap, but it would be absolutely fascinating to get an inside look into other artists’ creative processes and to show off your own work! <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6020">Art from Start to Finish</a> is open for sign up through the 30th of August. After that you have a full month (until October 1st) to create and document your art. Please see the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/6020">swap’s info page</a> for the complete requirements. Good luck and happy swapping!</p>

		<p>Travis worked hard making a few improvements to the site this weekend. Here is what has been improved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is now a “games” category for swaps. You select up to three swap categories when creating each swap, and you can search by category on the “View all swaps” page.</li>
  <li>The image uploading problem when editing newly created swaps should now be fixed. You should have no problem uploading .jpgs, .gifs, or .pngs to represent your swaps now.</li>
  <li>The account self deletion option should now be working correctly. If you choose to delete your account (permanently) you can now click on the link at the very bottom of the “Edit Profile” page and, if you are not in any open swaps, your account will automatically be deleted. Previously this option had a few bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let us know if you notice any problems with these three improvements. Thanks!</p>

		<p>After a 2.5 month hiatus, weekly featured swaps are back! There are so many great swaps to choose from (577 open swaps right now!) it was hard to pick just one…</p>

<p><img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/327252352\_9db3711155\_m.jpg" alt="327252352\_9db3711155\_m.jpg" /> <img src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/390441590\_5b277daa9f\_m.jpg" alt="390441590\_5b277daa9f\_m.jpg" /></p>

<p>This week’s featured swap is the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/5970">Fiber Art Photography ATC Swap</a> hosted by &lt;a href=http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=9056”&gt;fiberfool&lt;/a&gt;. The swap is open for signup through the end of August, and your ATCs must be mailed to your three partners by September 14th. The swap is international and open to any swapper with a 4.5 rating or higher. Each participant will send three ATCs to each of their partners. &lt;img class=”alignright” src=&amp;#</p>

<p>ATCs are a very popular swap item, but despite their popularity I still get many emails asking what they are. ATCs are Artist Trading Cards. They are 2.5 x 3.5 inches in size, are created by hand, and are either one-of-a-kind or in limited editions. For those of you who are new to them, here are a few links to ATC sites:</p>

		<p>Because of a few recent forum threads and many email complaints from users, I have determined it is necessary to post a bit of info about forum etiquette.</p>

<p>First of all, we love how active everyone is in the forums. It is wonderful when we see people answering questions and helping new users. Our policy is to NOT censor any forum posts or delete any threads. Each user is responsible for what they post to the forums… That is where things can get tricky!</p>

<p>Please be aware that members could be held legally responsible for damages to another member’s reputation if a court were to find that the remarks constitute libel or defamation. Under federal law – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a> – because Swap-bot does not censor feedback or investigate it for accuracy, Swap-bot is not legally responsible for the remarks that members post, even if those remarks are defamatory. However, this law does not protect the person who leaves the feedback from responsibility for it.</p>

<p>Basically, you are just as responsible for remarks you make in the Swap-bot forums as you are for things you say to so</p>

<div style="display: none">

</div>

<p>meone’s face or print in a publication. I know that bad swappers make us super-mad and frustrated, but we all have to try our best to remain civil and kind.</p>

<p>One more thing: although we created a “One-on-One Trades” category in the forums, Swap-bot cannot regulate these swaps and I cannot make sure that members send their items for these swaps. We are currently working on a way to incorporate one-on-one trades and tag-type swaps into the overall Swap-bot system and rating system, but it will take us a while to get it implemented. Until then, you are participating in the forum swaps completely at your own risk without any type of recourse (i.e. the rating system) available if you don’t receive items. Because we do not regulate these types of swaps, I cannot take the forum swaps into consideration when deciding whether someone needs to have their account frozen or deleted.</p>

<p>There are so many awesome, kind, creative, and fabulous users on Swap-bot. Don’t let the few scammers get you down! We are trying our best to stay on top of them.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your help and happy swapping!</p>

		<p>Hi swapper friends!</p>

<p>I just wanted to let everyone know that I have been out of town for the last five weeks, but I am finally back. I will be re-assuming all email, blog, and forum duties immediately. It may take me a few days to get caught up with all of my Swap-bot email and messages, but know that I am working on it diligently.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience,</p>

		<p>You will probably notice in the next little while that we have disabled the ability to color your display names. We have also disabled the ability to use HTML to change the format of your text and profiles. For security reasons we can no longer allow the use of HTML for formatting on the site. Any HTML used in your profile pages, swap pages, or in the forums will no longer work.</p>

<p>I know that everyone was LOVING the name colors, and that many of you had very beautiful and creative profiles. You can still use Markdown to format text on the site. We also hope to have a more systematic way of spiffing up your profile page soon. (With the option for background images and everything!) We will even add in an option for changing the color of your profile name. We just cannot allow the use of HTML at this time. You may have to adjust some of the content on your profile pages. I am sorry for this inconvenience.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/forums/topic/98">this forum post</a> <u style="display:none">[Baby on Board download](http://www.turtlesurvival.org/?baby_on_board)</u></p>

<p>&lt;/u&gt; by Cloverst for instructions for using Markdown.</p>

<p>I am very sorry for this disappointment. We will try to implement the profile decorating options as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>TIP:</strong></p>

<p style="display:none">
  <a href="http://utero.pe/?the_way_of_the_gun">The Way of the Gun release</a>
</p>

<p>You can still put some images on your profile if you would like (although too many images may load very slowly and be distracting). Here is the Markdown code for linking to images –</p>

<p>`![image title](URL of image you want to link to)`</p>

<p>It must have the exclamation point first, followed by the image title in brackets, followed by the image link in parenthesis. Good luck!</p>

I love her magazines the most (Weddings is just awesome!) and her new <a href="http://www.marthastewartcrafts.com/index.php?v=msc_products&amp;sort=-price&amp;DCMP=KNC-G-MS_Crafts&amp;pa=netramind&amp;HBX_OU=50&amp;HBX_PK=martha%20stewart%20craft">craft line</a> at Michaels is great. Because of my love for all things Martha, I couldn’t pass up the <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/swap/show/3984">Martha Stewart 101 swap</a> for this week’s featured swap. Here is the description from the swap page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This swap is for those that really enjoy Martha Stewarts creations from her t.v show, magazines and her online site. This swap requires you to send out a Martha Stewart inspired item, store bought or made or you can even send a kit with instructions to how to make something. Please send nice items out, nobody wants to get junk they will just end up trashing. You will have 1 partner and please try to make the swap $8-$10 before postage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You must have a rating above 4.5 with a filled out profile in order to participate in this swap. I believe the swap is international, but you should check with the coordinator, <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/member/?id=63">LadyYing</a>, to make sure. Also, the swap closes for sign-up on June 1st, so act quickly if you would like to participate!</p>

		<p>We have finally updated the rating system! Here are the two main changes:</p>

<p>The top rating option (5) now becomes available immediately. Meaning that as soon as partners are assigned for each swap, the top rating option is available to be marked. So, now you can give your partners a “5” (and a heart) as soon as their package arrives. The two lower rating options (3 and 1) do not become available until two weeks after the mail deadline for each swap. This is a bit of a change. All of the rating options used to become available one week after the mail deadline for each swap. We have had many, many requests for immediate rating capabilities. Please check out the new system and let us know how it is working.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://swap-bot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/star.png" alt="star.png" />The second big change is that we have implemented the Coordinator Star system! This is a slightly complicated system, but it is a nice way to reward hard working coordinators. Now, when you open the rating window for each swap there is a Coordinator Star box. In that box you can mark either that your coordinator deserves a star, or they do NOT deserve a star. Coordinators do not receive a star for every person who marks yes to the star option, instead they must receive stars from 75% of the <em>rating</em> participants in their swap. Meaning that of the people in the swap who give one of the two ratings for the coordinator, 75% must mark the positive option for a star to be received. If a participant does not rate at all they are not included in the equation. Also, coordinators canNOT be hurt by this system. They can only <em>receive</em> stars, not have them deducted.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> My previous statement about the stars is somewhat confusing and inaccurate. The number of stars you receive can change as more members from each of the swaps you host rate you. If the percentage of participants who rate you positively for each swap drops below 75% at any time, you will lose the star for that swap. What I meant to say above is that if more than 75% of people in a swap rate you negatively, that does not hurt you. You simply do not receive a star for that swap. (It does not create a negative star.)</p>

<p>I hope that explains things a bit better!</p>

<p>I hope that makes the new rating changes somewhat clear. Try them out and let us know if you have any questions.<u style="display:none">[Motel Hell rip](http://londongirlgeekdinners.co.uk/?motel_hell)</u></p>
